# Swapify Backend Documentation

## 31 July Update — Password reset + Google sign-in

Three new auth features, plus the diagnostics that make each of them provably
working rather than silently broken. All in [`src/app.py`](src/app.py) and
[`weekly_digest.py`](weekly_digest.py); `python test_scoring_spec.py` still passes
100/100, and `test_api.sh` / `test_api.ps1` / `test_live_api.ps1` all gained
permanent assertions (sections `105a`–`105o`, `128a`–`128k`).

**[`POST /forgot-password`](#post-forgot-password)** emails a single-use reset link.

- The response is **identical for a registered and an unregistered address** — a
  reset form that says "no such user" is how account lists get harvested.
- Only a **SHA-256 hash** of the token is stored (peppered with `SECRET_KEY`), so a
  leaked database still cannot be used to take over accounts.
- Tokens are single-use and expire in `PASSWORD_RESET_TTL_MINUTES` (default 30).
  Requesting a new link, or using one, invalidates every other outstanding link.
- Throttled to `FORGOT_PASSWORD_MAX_PER_HOUR` per address (×4 per caller IP).

**[`POST /reset-password`](#post-reset-password)** consumes the token and sets the
new password, with [`GET /reset-password/validate`](#get-reset-password-validate) to
check a link before showing the form and [`GET /reset-password`](#get-reset-password)
serving the page the emailed link opens — so password reset works with **no frontend
deployed**, since the web app is hosted separately from this API.

**[Google OAuth 2.0](#google-oauth-20-sign-in)** — [`GET /auth/google/login`](#get-authgooglelogin)
starts the authorization-code flow and [`GET /auth/google/callback`](#get-authgooglecallback)
finishes it, issuing the **same JWT `POST /login` returns**, so every existing
authenticated endpoint works unchanged. [`POST /auth/google/token`](#post-authgoogletoken)
covers clients that already hold an ID token (Google Identity Services, mobile SDKs);
those are signature-verified, since they arrive from an untrusted source. Signing in
with a Google address that already has a password account **links** the two instead
of creating a duplicate row that would strand the user's scan history. State is
HMAC-signed (CSRF) and post-sign-in redirects are restricted to already-trusted
origins (no open redirect handing out tokens).

**Two bugs found and fixed while testing:**

- **`.env` mail settings were never applied.** `app.py` imported `weekly_digest`
  ~170 lines *before* it called `load_dotenv()`, so every SMTP/SendGrid setting was
  read from the bare process environment and ignored. `load_dotenv()` now runs first
  and `weekly_digest` resolves its config per send. Symptom: mail configuration
  appeared to do nothing.
- **USDA answered barcode lookups with unrelated records.** `/foods/search` is a
  full-text search, not a GTIN lookup, and the code assumed "a barcode match is
  exact and needs no guard". Searching `0000000000000` returned the paper *"A
  comprehensive characterization of phenolics, amino acids…"*, which was scored and
  **written into `products` as a real product**. A barcode hit must now carry that
  exact `gtinUpc`.

**Diagnostics** (the reason each feature can be shown to work):
[`GET /auth/email/status`](#get-authemailstatus) reports which mail provider is
actually live — and `?probe=true` (admin) opens a real SMTP session.
[`GET /autofill/status`](#get-autofillstatus) reports which auto-fill sources and
search providers are reachable. `GET /health` now carries `email_provider` and
`google_oauth`.

> **Setup note — Gmail SMTP needs an App Password.** Verified live against
> `smtp.gmail.com:587`: the account password is rejected with
> `534 5.7.9 Application-specific password required`. Generate a 16-character App
> Password at <https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords> and set it as
> `SMTP_PASSWORD`. Until then the app stays in outbox dry-run mode **and says so**
> rather than accepting reset requests whose mail goes nowhere.

## 30 July Update — Auto-fill, Google net, uncapped Categories

Three reviewer tasks, all in [`src/app.py`](src/app.py) (+ a new bundled dataset at
`data/ifct2017.json`). `python test_scoring_spec.py` still passes 100/100.

**Task 1 — Auto-fill pipeline.** Products with missing data got none because two of
the five sources could not contribute at all:

- **IFCT was a dead no-op** — no dataset ever shipped, so the step was skipped
  silently on every request. A curated Indian generic-foods table now ships, and
  matching is relevance-gated so a generic record can't answer for a branded pack.
- **The safety net was starved of time** — it runs last and shared a 6 s budget with
  Open Food Facts and USDA, so it usually started with under a second left. It now
  has its own budget (`SWAPIFY_WEB_NET_BUDGET`, 12 s). Ordinary scans are unchanged
  (in-DB **0.1 s**, cached **0.01 s**, first OFF fetch **~0.9 s**, total miss ~2.5 s
  then negative-cached).
- **New [`GET /product/by-name/{name}`](#get-product-by-name)** runs the same chain
  from a name, because a product no barcode database indexes could not previously be
  looked up at all — which is exactly the class of product that shows no data.
- **New `?refresh=true`** on both product endpoints forces a re-resolve past the
  caches and the enrichment cooldown.

**Task 2 — [Google safety net](#google-web-safety-net).** It required a **paid
SerpApi key that was never configured**, so every product reaching it fell through
to a rate-limited free LLM: the net existed but never fetched anything. It now runs
a provider chain (SerpApi → **Google Programmable Search** → DuckDuckGo → Bing →
Mojeek) whose last entries need no key, extracts nutrition from both result snippets
and fetched pages, and rescales per serving size — reading a "200 kcal per 500 g
bottle" panel as per-100g was a 2.5× error straight into the catalogue. Values are
sanity-checked, relevance-gated, flagged `estimated`, and carry the `source_urls`
they came from. **Set `GOOGLE_API_KEY` + `GOOGLE_CSE_ID`** (free, 100 queries/day)
for dependable behaviour; the keyless engines throttle scripted access.

**Task 3 — [Categories return everything](#31-product-categories-api-feature-4).**
Two bugs: the `categories_tags` filter was being passed as a request parameter that
Search-a-licious **accepts and ignores** (a request for `en:biscuits` returned grated
carrots), and the advertised product count was `SWAPIFY_CATEGORY_EXTERNAL_LIMIT` —
our own 200-per-category fetch cap — rather than anything about Open Food Facts. The
filter moved into the Lucene `q`, counts are now OFF's real per-category totals, and
`limit`/`offset` page straight into OFF instead of paginating a pre-fetched buffer.
**Measured: 385 → 181,105 browsable products**, `offset=9995` still serves results.

## 27 July Update — Reviewer Fixes

Nine reviewer-reported issues, all in [`src/app.py`](src/app.py) +
[`static/script.js`](static/script.js). Verified via TestClient against a temp DB
copy; `python test_scoring_spec.py` still passes 100/100.

1. **Scanner too slow (20 s+ → < 5 s).** The whole external auto-fill chain is now
   bounded by one wall-clock budget (`SWAPIFY_AUTOFILL_BUDGET`, 6 s), the slow AI
   estimate is capped separately (4 s), OFF/USDA timeouts are lowered, unknown
   barcodes are cached as misses (instant `404` on rescan), and a partially-filled
   product isn't re-fetched every scan. In-DB **0.1 s**, cached **0.01 s**, first
   external fetch **< 4.2 s**. See [Auto-Fill Pipeline](#1b-auto-fill-missing-data-pipeline-database-first).
2. **"Unknown Product" name.** A product resolved from OFF/USDA now always gets a
   real name (brand fallback), never the literal placeholder.
3. **Auto-fill actually fills.** Added an **Open Food Facts name search** (so packs
   not indexed by their scanned barcode still resolve) and a **relevance guard** that
   rejects garbage fuzzy matches (USDA answering *"Amul Fruit N Nut"* with
   *"McDonald's Fruit'n Yogurt Parfait"*).
4. **Google/AI safety net** is bounded + logged, no longer hangs a scan.
5. **AI chat uses the DB.** Fixed the name lookup (*"Kellogg's Multigrain Chocos"* →
   **"Chocos cereal"**) and the fast-path reply now returns `product_name`/`score`/
   `grade`/`ingredient_flags`. See [Product lookup by name](#product-lookup-by-name-fix-3b).
6. **Categories include Open Food Facts.** [`/products/by-category`](#31-product-categories-api-feature-4)
   merges OFF products (`external_count` in the response).
7. **Search includes Open Food Facts.** [`/search`](#11-search-products-api) merges
   OFF name-search results (*"Mother Dairy"* now returns products); each item has a
   `source`.
8. **Report-missing works.** [`/report-missing`](#9-report-missing-product-api) auth is
   now optional (anonymous reports allowed) with robust error handling.
9. **Sodium vs salt consistency.** The frontend no longer flags bare "Salt" as
   harmful when the sodium panel reads 0 mg.

> Open Food Facts integration (#3/#6/#7) uses OFF's
> [Search-a-licious](https://search.openfoodfacts.org) API — the legacy
> `cgi/search.pl` endpoint is rate-limited and returns 503 HTML, which is why name
> search previously found nothing. All new behaviour is env-tunable and on by
> default (`SWAPIFY_EXTERNAL_SEARCH`).

## 22 July Update — Fixes & New Features

This release ships four fixes and four features. Details are in the linked
sections; this is the summary.

**Fixes**

1. **Nutrition now shown per 100g (not per serving).** Product responses carry a
   new `nutrition_per_100g` block — each nutrient scaled by `100 / serving_size_g`
   so a 200 ml drink no longer reports its full-serving numbers under a "per 100g"
   label. Per-serving fields are retained for backward compatibility.
   See [Get Product Details](#1-get-product-details-api).
2. **CSV ↔ scanner score consistency.** All backend endpoints already score
   through one engine (`calculate_health_score_v2`, which implements
   [`ScoringLogic_Swapify.md`](ScoringLogic_Swapify.md) — verified by
   [`test_scoring_spec.py`](test_scoring_spec.py)); the frontend's own client-side
   scorer was rewritten to mirror it exactly (per-serving penalties, per-100g
   bonuses, category caps, transparency, 1–10 clamp), and the client catalogue CSV
   is regenerated from the database via [`export_products.py`](export_products.py)
   so both sides read identical data. A product now scores the same in a CSV list
   and when scanned. See [Health Scoring Logic](#health-scoring-logic-v2).
3. **AI chat: structured + product-aware.** Replies are now structured Markdown
   (headline, **Key Highlights**, **Why it scored…**, **Healthier Alternative**),
   and a product named in the question ("Frooti score", "is Maggi healthy?") is
   looked up from the catalogue even with nothing scanned; if it isn't found the
   bot tells the user to scan the barcode. See [AI Nutritionist Chatbot](#13-ai-nutritionist-chatbot-api).
4. **All products load.** The client catalogue CSV drifted to a ~101-row subset;
   it is regenerated from the full 252-product database so every product (e.g.
   *Slurrp Farm Ragi, Almond & Banana Cereals*) is scannable.

**Features**

1. **New dietary preferences** — `no_preservatives`, `no_artificial_colors`,
   `no_artificial_flavors`, `no_palm_oil`, and `clean_label` (all four at once).
   These *filter* products (search / recommendations respect them) rather than
   re-weighting the score. See [Dietary Preferences](#12-dietary-preferences-api)
   and [`GET /preferences/available`](#12a-available-preferences-api).
2. **"Better For You" badge** — product responses and list items carry
   `is_better_for_you` (`true` when score ≥ 7). See [Better For You Badge](#27a-better-for-you-badge-feature-2).
3. **Weekly digest email** — templated HTML/text digest (week's scans, favourites,
   challenge progress) with pluggable delivery (SendGrid / SMTP / dry-run outbox),
   a one-click signed unsubscribe link, and a cron runner
   ([`cron_weekly_digest.py`](cron_weekly_digest.py)). See [Weekly Digest Email](#22a-weekly-digest-email-api-feature-3).
4. **Product categories** — `GET /products/categories` and
   `GET /products/by-category/{category}` (paginated, scored). See [Product Categories](#31-product-categories-api-feature-4).

## Live Deployment

- **Live base URL:** `https://swapify-3.onrender.com`
- **Interactive docs (live):** `https://swapify-3.onrender.com/docs`
- **Health check:** `https://swapify-3.onrender.com/health` → `{"status":"ok", "uptime_seconds": …}`

The backend runs on Render as a **persistent, managed web service** — gunicorn with
two uvicorn workers, supervised by Render's infrastructure. It is not attached to
any terminal: closing the terminal, logging out, or shutting the laptop has no
effect on it, and a crashed worker is respawned automatically. `GET /health`
reports `uptime_seconds`, which is the simplest proof — the number keeps climbing
across your machine being switched off entirely.

**Keeping it awake.** Render's free tier spins an instance down after ~15 minutes
of inactivity, and the next request then pays a ~30-50s cold start. An UptimeRobot
monitor pings `/health` every 5 minutes, which keeps the instance warm and doubles
as a downtime alert. Setup: [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](DEPLOYMENT.md) §10.

All endpoints below are relative to the base URL — use `http://127.0.0.1:8000`
locally or the live URL above. The full step-by-step deployment process
(Render / Railway / PythonAnywhere), environment variables, uptime monitoring, and
the database-first + sync workflow are documented in
[`DEPLOYMENT.md`](DEPLOYMENT.md).

**Database-first & CSV sync:** the API reads product data only from the SQLite
database. `products.csv` is used solely to *seed* a fresh database on first boot
and to *sync* updates via [`sync_db.py`](sync_db.py) (`python sync_db.py`, or
`--dry-run` to preview). No local/developer file paths are hard-coded — the DB and
CSV locations come from env vars (`SWAPIFY_DB_PATH`, `SWAPIFY_CSV_PATH`) and
otherwise resolve relative to the app.

> After deploying, update the three URLs above and share the live base URL with
> the team.

## How to run the backend
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `server` directory.
   ```bash
   cd C:/Users/Dhruv/Documents/Intership/day_32/server
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies from `requirements.txt`:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. (Optional, for the AI Nutritionist `/chat` endpoint) Configure a free AI API
   key. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, or export it
   in your shell:
   ```bash
   # PowerShell
   $env:OPENROUTER_API_KEY = "your-key-here"
   ```
   Get a free key at https://openrouter.ai/keys (OpenRouter offers free-tier
   models). Optionally also set `GEMINI_API_KEY` (free at
   https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) — Gemini is then used as an automatic
   failover when OpenRouter's free models are rate-limited. If no key is
   configured, `/chat` still works using a deterministic, food-science fallback.
4. Run the backend server from the `server/src` directory:
   ```bash
   cd src
   python app.py
   ```
   Alternatively, run it using `uvicorn` directly from the `server` directory:
   ```bash
   uvicorn src.app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload
   ```

## How to test the endpoints
Once the server is running, the API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

### Automated test suite
Three end-to-end smoke tests live in the `server` directory and exercise **every**
endpoint (including the ratings, recommendations, share-card, AI chat,
barcode-validation, activity-logging, daily-digest, **weekly challenges &
leaderboard**, **smart-cart shopping-list optimization**, **community reviews** and
the **OCR label scanner** features), then verify the writes actually persisted to
`swapify.db`. `test_api.ps1` / `test_api.sh` auto-start a local server if one isn't
already running; `test_live_api.ps1` runs the same checks against the deployed API.

```bash
# Windows PowerShell — local
./test_api.ps1

# Windows PowerShell — against the deployed backend
./test_live_api.ps1

# Git Bash / WSL / Linux / macOS — local
bash test_api.sh
```

All three print a per-request `HTTP <code>` and a final `Passed / Failed` tally. The
AI `/chat` test reports its `source` (`openrouter`/`gemini` = real AI, `fallback`
= rule-based) so you can confirm the AI key is live.

**July 30 sections** (`101c`–`101e` in the local suites, `112c`–`112e` in the live
one) cover this update's work:

| Section | Asserts |
|---|---|
| `101`/`112` | `/products/categories` reports Open Food Facts' **real** per-category counts (a category in the thousands, not a 200 cap), and `count == db_count + external_count` on every tile |
| `101c`/`112c` | `/products/by-category/biscuit?offset=1000` still returns products, i.e. paging goes into Open Food Facts rather than a pre-fetched buffer |
| `101d`/`112d` | `GET /product/by-name/{name}` returns a scored product with a `resolution` trail |
| `101e`/`112e` | `GET /product/{barcode}?refresh=true` re-resolves and still returns the product |

The two network-dependent checks (the big category count and the deep page) **warn
instead of failing** when Open Food Facts is unreachable, so a flaky network doesn't
turn into a red test run.

### Interactive API Documentation
FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation. You can access it here:
- **Swagger UI:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`
- **ReDoc:** `http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc`

### Authentication APIs

#### Register
- **URL:** `/register`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Request Body (JSON):**
  - `email` (string)
  - `password` (string)
  - `username` (string)

#### Login
- **URL:** `/login`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Request Body (JSON):**
  - `email` (string)
  - `password` (string)
- **Response:** Returns a JWT `access_token`.

#### Get Profile
- **URL:** `/profile`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- **Response:** Returns user details.

<a id="post-forgot-password"></a>
#### POST /forgot-password
Emails a single-use password reset link.

- **Body:** `{"email": "you@example.com"}`
- **Response (always 200 for any valid-looking address):**
  ```json
  {
    "message": "If an account exists for that email, a password reset link is on its way. Check your inbox (and spam folder).",
    "expires_in_minutes": 30
  }
  ```
- **400** — the address is malformed. **429** — more than
  `FORGOT_PASSWORD_MAX_PER_HOUR` requests for that address in an hour.

The message is byte-identical whether or not the account exists: confirming which
addresses are registered is exactly how user lists get harvested. Only a SHA-256
hash of the token (peppered with `SECRET_KEY`) is stored, so the token exists in the
email and nowhere else. Issuing a link invalidates any earlier unused link for the
same account.

**Dev/CI only:** the response can also carry a `debug` object with `reset_url` and
`token`, so the flow is testable without an inbox. `PASSWORD_RESET_EXPOSE_TOKEN`
defaults to `auto`, which requires **both** that no mail provider is configured
**and** that `APP_BASE_URL` is a loopback address — because "no mail provider" is
also what a real deployment looks like when someone forgets `SMTP_PASSWORD`, which
is exactly when you least want tokens in responses. `1` forces it on for a recorded
demo, `0` off.

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/forgot-password \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d '{"email":"dhruv@example.com"}'
```

<a id="post-reset-password"></a>
#### POST /reset-password
Consumes the token from the email and sets the new password.

- **Body:** `{"token": "<from the link>", "new_password": "N3wPassw0rd!"}`
  (`password` is accepted as an alias for `new_password`.)
- **200:** `{"message": "Password updated. You can now log in with your new password.", "email": "...", "username": "..."}`
- **400:** token missing/invalid/**already used**/**expired**, or the password is
  shorter than `PASSWORD_MIN_LENGTH` (default 6). The message says which.

On success every other outstanding token for that account is invalidated too, so a
second link still sitting in the mailbox cannot be replayed later.

<a id="get-reset-password-validate"></a>
#### GET /reset-password/validate?token=…
Checks a link **before** showing the new-password form, so the page can say "this
link expired" up front instead of after someone has typed a new password twice.

```json
{"valid": true, "reason": "valid", "email": "d*********1@gmail.com", "expires_at": "2026-07-31T12:05:11", "message": "Link is valid. Choose a new password."}
```
Invalid: `{"valid": false, "reason": "expired|used|invalid|missing", "message": "…"}`.
The email is masked — the page needs to show *which* account, not disclose the
address to whoever holds the link.

<a id="get-reset-password"></a>
#### GET /reset-password
The HTML page the emailed link opens: a self-contained new-password form that POSTs
back to `/reset-password`. Served by the API itself so password reset works with no
frontend deployed (the web app is hosted separately). Point
`PASSWORD_RESET_URL_BASE` at the web app to use that page instead.

<a id="google-oauth-20-sign-in"></a>
### Google OAuth 2.0 Sign-in

Both entry points end in the **same JWT `POST /login` issues**, so every
authenticated endpoint works with a Google-signed-in user unchanged.

<a id="get-authgoogleconfig"></a>
#### GET /auth/google/config
What a frontend needs to render the button — and nothing secret.

```json
{"configured": true, "client_id": "3865…apps.googleusercontent.com",
 "redirect_uri": "https://swapify-3.onrender.com/auth/google/callback",
 "login_url": "https://swapify-3.onrender.com/auth/google/login",
 "scopes": ["openid","email","profile"], "credentials_source": "env"}
```
`configured: false` means `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`/`GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` are unset and
the `/auth/google/*` endpoints will return **503**. The web app hides the Google
button unless this says `true`, so it never offers a button that can only fail.

<a id="get-authgooglelogin"></a>
#### GET /auth/google/login
**302** to Google's consent screen. Aliased as `GET /auth/google`.

- `?return_to=` — where the browser lands afterwards. Must be an origin already
  trusted for CORS; anything else is **ignored, not honoured** (an open redirect
  here would hand our JWTs to whoever asked).
- `?flow=popup` — the callback hands the token back via `postMessage` to the exact
  opener origin instead of redirecting.

State is an HMAC-signed, self-contained token (10-minute TTL), so the callback is
CSRF-protected without server-side session storage.

<a id="get-authgooglecallback"></a>
#### GET /auth/google/callback
Where Google redirects back. Exchanges the code **server-side** (the client secret
never reaches the browser), validates the ID token's issuer/audience/expiry/verified
email, then finds, links or creates the account and issues a JWT.

Account matching order: Google's `sub` first (stable even if the person changes
their Gmail address), then the email address — which **links** an existing password
account rather than creating a duplicate row that would strand its scan history. An
account created by Google sign-in gets a random unusable password hash; the person
can use "forgot password" to add a real one.

Returns JSON when there is no frontend to hand off to (direct browser/API test):
```json
{"access_token":"eyJ…","token_type":"bearer","provider":"google",
 "user_id":89,"username":"Dhruv","email":"…","is_new_user":true}
```
**Configuration:** the `redirect_uri` this server sends must appear **verbatim** in
Google Cloud Console → Credentials → your OAuth client → *Authorised redirect URIs*,
or Google answers `redirect_uri_mismatch` (the error message says so explicitly).

<a id="post-authgoogletoken"></a>
#### POST /auth/google/token
For clients that already hold a Google ID token (Google Identity Services one-tap,
mobile SDKs).

- **Body:** `{"credential": "<Google ID token>"}` (`id_token` accepted as an alias)
- **200:** `access_token`, `token_type`, `user_id`, `username`, `email`,
  `avatar_url`, `is_new_user`, `linked_existing_account`
- **400** no token, **401** the token isn't valid, **503** Google unreachable.

Because this token arrives from an untrusted source its signature is verified — with
`cryptography` installed, locally against Google's JWKS; otherwise by Google's own
`tokeninfo` endpoint. (The `/callback` path skips signature verification only
because that token arrives in our own TLS response from Google's token endpoint,
which Google documents as sufficient; the claims are checked either way.)

<a id="get-authemailstatus"></a>
#### GET /auth/email/status
Is outgoing mail actually working? A password-reset feature that quietly writes to
`outbox/` looks identical to one that sends real mail; this is how you tell.

```json
{"provider": "outbox", "can_send_real_email": false,
 "password_reset_ttl_minutes": 30,
 "reset_link_base": "https://swapify-3.onrender.com/reset-password",
 "token_exposed_in_response": false,
 "note": "SMTP_USER is set (swapify.auth@gmail.com) but SMTP_PASSWORD is empty — for Gmail this must be a 16-character App Password from https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords"}
```

`?probe=true` (requires `X-Admin-Token`) opens a **real SMTP session** and reports
the server's own answer, including the Gmail App Password error with a fix hint:

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/auth/email/status?probe=true" -H "X-Admin-Token: $ADMIN_TOKEN"
```

A half-configured SMTP block (host + user, no password) can never authenticate, so
it is treated as **not configured**: the app falls back to the outbox dry-run and
says why, instead of accepting reset requests whose mail silently goes nowhere.

<a id="get-autofillstatus"></a>
#### GET /autofill/status
Which auto-fill sources and web-search providers are reachable right now. Exists
because an unresolvable product returns a plain 404 whether the product doesn't
exist or every search provider is refusing us — the ambiguity behind "the Google
safety net isn't fetching anything". Reports per provider whether it is configured
and whether it is in cooldown, and warns when no *keyed* search provider is set:

```json
{"has_dependable_search": false,
 "warning": "No keyed search provider is configured, so the Google safety net depends on keyless engines that rate-limit server IPs … set GOOGLE_API_KEY and GOOGLE_CSE_ID. Free tier: 100 queries/day."}
```

### 1. Get Product Details API
This endpoint returns all the detailed information (ingredients, nutritional facts) for a given product by its barcode. It also records the scan in the scan history if `device_id` is provided.

The response includes an **`ingredient_flags`** array listing every detected harmful
ingredient together with its **risk level** (`Low` / `Medium` / `High` / `Severe`).
Risk levels are stored in the database (`ingredient_rules.risk_level`) — see
[Ingredient Risk Levels](#ingredient-risk-levels) below.

**Resolution is database-FIRST (auto-fill pipeline).** The barcode is resolved
against **our database first**; only if a core nutrient is missing does it fall
back — in strict priority order — to **Open Food Facts → USDA FoodData Central →
IFCT 2017 → a [Google/web safety net](#google-web-safety-net)**. Whatever a fallback
fills is normalised to per-100g and **written back to our database**, so the next
scan of that product is served locally with no network call. The `source` field names
the primary origin (`database`, `openfoodfacts`, `usda`, `ifct2017`, `google`), and a
`resolution` object records the full audit trail (`sources_tried`, `enriched_by`,
`filled_fields`, `matched_on`, `estimated`, `source_urls`). If every source fails the
product is flagged for manual review and a `404` is returned. See
[Auto-Fill Missing-Data Pipeline](#auto-fill-missing-data-pipeline) for details.

Every product carries a **`confidence`** rating derived from how *complete* its
data is — never a blanket "High". The five levels are **Very High** (all six
nutrients + ingredients), **High** (most data, ≥5 nutrients), **Medium** (some
data), **Low** (only ingredients), **Very Low** (no data). The `confidence_meta`
object shows the evidence (`data_availability`, `nutrients_present`,
`missing_fields`, `completeness`). Data filled by the estimating Google/AI net is
capped at **Medium**. See [Data Confidence](#data-confidence).

The response always includes an **`image_url`** — the product's contributed image
or the shared placeholder (`/product-images/_placeholder.svg`) when it has none
(see [Product Image Upload](#28-product-image-upload-api)). Generic (non-personalized)
product details are served from a 1-hour cache (see [`PERFORMANCE.md`](PERFORMANCE.md)).

If an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header is sent and the user has saved dietary
preferences, the `score`, `grade` and `breakdown` are **personalized** and the
response includes a `preferences_applied` object (see
[Personalized Scoring](#personalized-scoring)). Without a token the generic score
is returned.

The barcode is **validated** on the way in (see
[Barcode Validation & Correction](#20-barcode-validation--correction-api)). If it
is malformed, a `barcode_validation` object (with a suggested correction) is added
to the response — including on the `404` body, so a client can retry with the
suggestion. Valid barcodes omit this field.

- **URL:** `/product/{barcode}`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Headers (optional):** `Authorization: Bearer <token>` — personalize the score for the logged-in user.
- **Query Parameters:**
  - `device_id` (optional): A unique device identifier to record the scan history.
  - `refresh` (optional, boolean, July 30): re-run the auto-fill chain for this
    barcode now, bypassing the 1-hour product cache, the negative-resolution cache
    and the enrichment cooldown. Use it after fixing missing data (or to
    demonstrate the pipeline); a normal scan never needs it. Without it, a product
    that failed to fill keeps *looking* empty for the next 10 minutes even after
    the cause is fixed. See
    [Auto-Fill Missing-Data Pipeline](#auto-fill-missing-data-pipeline).

**Related:** [`GET /product/by-name/{name}`](#get-product-by-name) resolves the same
way from a **product name** instead of a barcode — for the packs no barcode database
indexes, which are exactly the ones that otherwise show no data.

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/product/8901058005783            # Maggi noodles
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/product/8901058005783?refresh=true"   # force a re-resolve

<a name="data-confidence"></a>
### 1a. Data Confidence  (Tasks 2 & 7)

Every scored product carries a **`confidence`** string that reflects **how complete
its data is** — it is *not* a fixed "High". This replaces the old behaviour where a
product with no nutrition still showed "High" confidence.

| Data available | `confidence` |
|---|---|
| All six nutrients **and** ingredients | **Very High** |
| Most data present (≥ 5 of 6 nutrients) | **High** |
| Some data present (1–4 nutrients) | **Medium** |
| Only ingredients present (no nutrients) | **Low** |
| No data present | **Very Low** |

The six nutrients counted are calories, sugar, protein, sodium, fibre and saturated
fat. A genuine `0` counts as present (it is data); only `null`/blank is missing.
`confidence_meta` exposes the evidence:

```json
"confidence_meta": {
  "level": "Medium",
  "class": "confidence-medium",
  "completeness": 0.571,
  "nutrients_present": 4,
  "nutrients_total": 6,
  "has_ingredients": false,
  "data_availability": {"calories": true, "sugar": true, "protein": true,
                         "sodium": true, "fiber": false, "saturated_fat": false,
                         "ingredients": false},
  "missing_fields": ["fiber", "saturated_fat", "ingredients"]
}
```

Data filled by the estimating Google/AI safety net is **capped at Medium** (with
`"capped_reason": "estimated_source"`) so a best-effort guess can never present as
"Very High".

<a name="auto-fill-missing-data-pipeline"></a>
### 1b. Auto-Fill Missing-Data Pipeline  (database-first)

Product resolution checks **our database first** and only reaches out when a core
nutrient is actually missing, in strict priority order:

| # | Source | Provides |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Swapify database** (CSV-seeded) | our curated data — **always checked first** |
| 2 | **Open Food Facts** | barcode lookup **then a name search** (via [Search-a-licious](https://search.openfoodfacts.org)), nutrition, ingredients, image |
| 3 | **USDA FoodData Central** | 600k foods, detailed nutrition (`USDA_API_KEY`, defaults to `DEMO_KEY`) |
| 4 | **IFCT 2017** (Indian Foods) | generic Indian foods, per-100g — bundled subset at `data/ifct2017.json`, override with `IFCT_DATA_PATH` |
| 5 | **Google / web safety net** | last resort — a real web search + nutrition-panel extraction, then an AI estimate |

The chain stops as soon as the six core nutrients are present. Anything a fallback
fills is **normalised to per-100g** and **written back to our database**, so the
next scan of that product is served locally with no network call. If every source
fails, the product is flagged for manual review (`missing_reports`) and the endpoint
returns `404`.

**Fixes (July 30) — why products with missing data showed nothing:**

- **Source 4 (IFCT) was a dead no-op.** No dataset ever shipped, so
  `os.path.exists` was `False` on every request: `ifct2017` appeared in
  `sources_tried` but could not contribute a single value. A curated subset of
  Indian generic-food composition values now ships at `data/ifct2017.json`, and a
  missing file is logged as a warning instead of passing silently. Matching is
  relevance-gated like the other name-based sources, so the generic "Amla" record
  answers a query for amla and never a query for a *branded* amla drink (whose
  numbers are different, and which should fall through to the safety net).
- **Source 5 got no time to run.** It shares a 6s budget with OFF and USDA and
  runs *last*, so by the time it started there was often under a second left —
  nowhere near enough to search the web and read a page, so it always came back
  empty. It now gets a budget of its own (`SWAPIFY_WEB_NET_BUDGET`, 12s). This
  does not slow ordinary scans: a product Open Food Facts knows never reaches
  source 5, and a product that does is resolved once and then served from our DB.
- **Products with no barcode anywhere were unreachable.** The chain could only be
  entered by barcode, so a product no barcode database indexes could not be looked
  up at all — searching for it returned nothing and it stayed permanently empty.
  [`GET /product/by-name/{name}`](#get-product-by-name) runs the same chain from a
  name and stores the result under a stable key.
- **`?refresh=true`** on `/product/{barcode}` and `/product/by-name/{name}` forces
  a re-resolve, bypassing the product cache, the negative-resolution cache and the
  enrichment cooldown. Without it a product that failed to fill kept *looking*
  empty for the next ten minutes even after the cause was fixed.

**Speed & data-quality guards (July 27):**

- The whole fallback chain is bounded by a single wall-clock budget
  (`SWAPIFY_AUTOFILL_BUDGET`, 6s) — each source only gets `min(its timeout, the
  budget left)`, and the slow AI estimate is capped separately
  (`SWAPIFY_AI_ESTIMATE_TIMEOUT`, 4s) — so a scan can never hang for 20s+ on a
  slow/unresponsive source.
- A barcode that resolves to **nothing anywhere** is cached as a miss for
  `SWAPIFY_NEGATIVE_TTL` (600s) so repeat scans return an instant `404` instead of
  re-running the chain; a product that resolves but stays *partially* incomplete
  is not re-fetched for `SWAPIFY_ENRICH_COOLDOWN` (600s).
- Name-based matches (USDA search, OFF name search) must be **relevant** — at least
  half of the query's identifying words must appear in the candidate — so a loose
  fuzzy match (e.g. USDA answering "Amul Fruit N Nut" with "McDonald's Fruit'n
  Yogurt Parfait") can't inject an unrelated product's nutrition. A barcode/GTIN
  match is exact and skips this check.
- `product_name` is guaranteed non-placeholder: a product resolved from OFF/USDA
  that has no name (or the literal "Unknown Product") falls back to its brand, so
  the client always shows a real label.

Each `/product` response reports the outcome:

```json
"source": "database",
"data_source": "database",
"resolution": {
  "source": "openfoodfacts",
  "sources_tried": ["database", "openfoodfacts", "usda"],
  "enriched_by": ["usda"],
  "filled_fields": ["fiber_g_per_serving"],
  "matched_on": "barcode",
  "estimated": false,
  "source_urls": []
}
```

`source_urls` lists the pages a web-derived value came from, so an estimate can be
traced (and a wrong auto-fill diagnosed) rather than taken on faith.

<a name="google-web-safety-net"></a>
#### Source 5 — the Google / web safety net

The net used to be "SerpApi, else ask an LLM". **SerpApi needs a paid key that was
never configured**, so in practice every product that got this far fell through to
a free-tier LLM estimate that is usually rate-limited and returns nothing — the net
existed but never actually fetched anything. It now runs a provider chain whose
last entries need no key at all:

| Order | Provider | Key required |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | SerpApi | `SERPAPI_KEY` |
| 2 | **Google Programmable Search JSON API** | `GOOGLE_API_KEY` + `GOOGLE_CSE_ID` — **recommended** |
| 3 | DuckDuckGo (HTML, then Lite) | none |
| 4 | Bing (RSS) | none |
| 5 | Mojeek | none |

> **Set `GOOGLE_API_KEY` + `GOOGLE_CSE_ID` for production.** It is the official
> Google Search API, free for 100 queries/day — far more than this net needs, since
> it only runs for a product no food database describes and the answer is then
> stored permanently. The keyless engines do work, but they answer a burst of
> scripted requests with a challenge page instead of results, so without a key the
> net is best-effort rather than dependable.

Extraction runs in two passes, cheapest first:

1. **the result snippets**, which for a well-indexed product already carry the
   panel ("Kapiva Amla Juice contains 200 calories per 1 Bottle (500g)");
2. **the top relevant result pages**, fetched in parallel and mined for their
   nutrition table — only when a score-driving nutrient is still missing.

Guards on what it will believe:

- **Relevance** — a result's title/snippet (and a page's opening text) must pass
  the same `_name_is_relevant` check as the other sources, so a search for "Kapiva
  Wild Amla Juice" can never be answered with Dabur's amla juice panel.
- **Serving-size awareness** — the reference quantity is detected per nutrition
  block and everything is rescaled to per-100g. Reading a panel as if it were
  already per-100g turns a 500 g bottle's 200 kcal into a 200 kcal/100 g juice.
  On a page carrying several bases at once (a "per 100g" heading in one section, a
  "Serving size 1 Bottle 500 g" panel in another), each block is parsed under its
  own basis and a block that states its reference quantity beats one that does not.
- **Sanity limits** — 100 g of food cannot exceed 900 kcal, 100 g sugar/protein/
  fibre/saturated fat or 40,000 mg sodium; a value past those means a price or a
  percentage was mis-read, and it is dropped.
- Everything the net returns is flagged `estimated: true`, which caps the
  product's [confidence](#data-confidence) at **Medium**.

**Config (all optional, safe defaults):** `SWAPIFY_AUTOFILL` (on), `SWAPIFY_GOOGLE_FALLBACK`
(on), `SWAPIFY_SOURCE_TIMEOUT` (5s), `SWAPIFY_AUTOFILL_BUDGET` (6s),
`SWAPIFY_AI_ESTIMATE_TIMEOUT` (4s), `SWAPIFY_OFF_TIMEOUT` (5s),
`SWAPIFY_NEGATIVE_TTL` (600s), `SWAPIFY_ENRICH_COOLDOWN` (600s), `USDA_API_KEY`,
`SERPAPI_KEY`, `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, `GOOGLE_CSE_ID`, `IFCT_DATA_PATH`,
`SWAPIFY_WEB_SEARCH` (on), `SWAPIFY_WEB_NET_BUDGET` (12s), `SWAPIFY_WEB_PAGES` (4),
`SWAPIFY_WEB_PAGE_TIMEOUT` (5s), `SWAPIFY_WEB_NET_TTL` (3600s),
`SWAPIFY_WEB_PROVIDER_COOLDOWN` (300s). Complete database products (the whole
curated catalogue) make **zero** network calls.

<a name="get-product-by-name"></a>
#### GET /product/by-name/{name}

Look up (and auto-fill) a product by **name** instead of barcode — the same
DB-first chain, for the products no barcode database indexes.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/product/by-name/Kapiva%20Wild%20Amla%20Juice"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/product/by-name/Nutella?refresh=true"
```

- `refresh=true` — ignore the enrichment cooldown and resolve again.
- Returns the same payload as `GET /product/{barcode}` (score, grade, breakdown,
  per-100g nutrition, confidence) plus `resolution`, which names every source
  tried and the pages any web-derived value came from.
- A product resolved this way is stored under a stable key derived from its name
  (`sw-<hash>`, outside the numeric space a real scan can produce), so it appears
  in search and in its category from the next request on.
- `404` with `{"error", "query", "sources_tried"}` when nothing describes the name.

### 2. Get Product Health Score API
This endpoint returns only the health score and the corresponding grade for a given product by its barcode.

- **URL:** `/score/{barcode}`
- **Method:** `GET`

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/score/8901491101837
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "score": 6.0,
  "grade": "C",
  "breakdown": {
    "base_score": 5.0,
    "nutrient_penalties": 0.0,
    "ingredient_penalties": 0.0,
    "nutrient_bonuses": 1.0,
    "ingredient_bonuses": 0.0,
    "final_score": 6.0
  }
}
```

**Expected Error Response (404 Not Found):**
```json
{
  "error": "Product not found"
}
```

### 3. Get Product Health Score V2 API
This endpoint uses the versioned scoring engine to return the health score, grade, and the rule version applied for a given product by its barcode.

- **URL:** `/v2/score/{barcode}`
- **Method:** `GET`

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/v2/score/8901491101837
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "score": 6.0,
  "grade": "C",
  "rule_version": 1,
  "breakdown": {
    "base_score": 5.0,
    "nutrient_penalties": 0.0,
    "ingredient_penalties": 0.0,
    "nutrient_bonuses": 1.0,
    "ingredient_bonuses": 0.0,
    "final_score": 6.0
  }
}
```

**Expected Error Response (404 Not Found):**
```json
{
  "error": "Product not found"
}
```

### 4. Compare Products API
This endpoint returns the detailed information for two given products by their barcodes.

- **URL:** `/compare/{barcode1}/{barcode2}`
- **Method:** `GET`

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/compare/8901491101837/8901491101838
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "product1": {

    "product_name": "Lay's Classic Salted",
    "brand": "Lay's",
    "serving_size_g": 28.0,
    "sugar_g_per_serving": 0.3,
    "saturated_fat_g_per_serving": 1.8,
    "sodium_mg_per_serving": 370.0,
    "protein_g_per_serving": 2.0,
    "fiber_g_per_serving": 1.0,
    "calories_kcal_per_serving": 150.0
  },
  "product2": null
}
```

**Expected Error Response (404 Not Found):**
```json
{
  "error": "Both products not found"
}
```

### 4a. Multi-Product Comparison API (`/compare-multiple`)
Compare **multiple products (2–4)** side-by-side in a single request, so the
frontend can render a clean comparison table. Each product is resolved from the
local database first and then **Open Food Facts** (so off-catalogue barcodes
still work), scored, and returned in a flat, table-friendly shape (nutrition,
health score, grade and `ingredient_flags`).

Any barcode that cannot be resolved anywhere is returned in the `not_found`
array instead of failing the whole request. Scores are **personalized** when an
`Authorization: Bearer <token>` header is sent and the user has saved dietary
preferences (see [Personalized Scoring](#personalized-scoring)).

- **URL:** `/compare-multiple`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Headers (optional):** `Authorization: Bearer <token>` — personalize the scores.
- **Request Body (JSON):**
  - `barcodes` (required, array of strings): 2–4 barcodes to compare. Blanks and
    duplicates are ignored.

**Example Request:**
```json
POST /compare-multiple
{
  "barcodes": ["8901058005783", "8908013479122", "8901491101837"]
}
```

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/compare-multiple \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"barcodes": ["8901058005783", "8908013479122", "8901491101837"]}'
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "count": 3,
  "products": [
    {
      "barcode": "8901058005783",
      "product_name": "Maggi noodles",
      "brand": "Maggi",
      "category": "noodles",
      "score": 1.0,
      "grade": "F",
      "sugar_g": 1.5,
      "protein_g": 6.2,
      "sodium_mg": 750.0,
      "saturated_fat_g": 6.8,
      "fiber_g": 2.5,
      "calories": 288.0,
      "ingredient_flags": [
        {"name": "maida", "risk": "High"},
        {"name": "palm oil", "risk": "Medium"},
        {"name": "tbhq", "risk": "Severe"}
      ],
      "source": "database"
    }
  ],
  "not_found": []
}
```

**Response fields (per product):** `barcode`, `product_name`, `brand`,
`category`, `score`, `grade`, `sugar_g`, `protein_g`, `sodium_mg`,
`saturated_fat_g`, `fiber_g`, `calories`, `ingredient_flags`, and `source`
(`database` or `openfoodfacts`). Top-level: `count` (resolved products) and
`not_found` (unresolved barcodes).

**Expected Error Response (400 Bad Request):** fewer than 2 or more than 4 barcodes.
```json
{
  "detail": "Provide at least 2 barcodes to compare"
}
```

### 5. Similar Products API ("Better Alternatives")
This endpoint returns healthier alternatives: products in the **same category** as
the scanned product with a **higher** health score, limited to 3 items.

> **Category matching (strict).** Alternatives are drawn **only** from the exact
> same category as the scanned product, using the shared category taxonomy in
> `src/category_taxonomy.py` (also used by the CSV seed, `sync_db.py` and
> `import_data.py`, so every code path agrees). If a product's category is
> unknown/`other`, the endpoint returns an **empty list** rather than a
> grab-bag — so, for example, *Ching's Schezwan Chutney* (category `sauce`)
> never surfaces *Maggi noodles* (category `noodles`) as an "alternative". A
> genuinely category-less product yields `[]`, which is the correct answer:
> better no suggestion than a mismatched one.

**Personalization (dietary preferences):** when the request identifies a user —
either via an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header **or** an explicit
`?user_id=` query parameter — the alternatives are tailored to that user's saved
dietary preferences (see [Personalized Scoring](#personalized-scoring)):

- All scores (the scanned product's and the candidates') are computed with the
  user's **personalized** weights, so "better" means better *for that user*.
- The results are **re-ranked** by the user's preferences: `high_protein` /
  `high_fiber` push higher-protein / higher-fiber products to the top;
  `low_sugar` / `low_sodium` / `low_fat` push lower-sugar / -sodium / -fat
  products to the top. The (personalized) health score is the final tie-breaker.
- `vegan` users have non-vegan alternatives **filtered out** when an ingredient
  list is available (products without ingredient data are not excluded).

With no preferences (or an anonymous request) the behaviour is the original
generic one: ordered by health score descending.

- **URL:** `/similar/{barcode}`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Headers (optional):** `Authorization: Bearer <token>` — personalize for the logged-in user.
- **Query Parameters:**
  - `user_id` (optional, int): Personalize for this user when no auth token is sent.

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**
```json
[
  {
    "barcode": "8906068720018",
    "product_name": "Max chocolate protein bar",
    "brand": "Max",
    "health_score": 5.8,
    "grade": "C",
    "sugar_g_per_serving": 9.0,
    "protein_g_per_serving": 20.0,
    "sodium_mg_per_serving": 150.0,
    "saturated_fat_g_per_serving": 5.0,
    "fiber_g_per_serving": 2.0,
    "image_url": "/product-images/_placeholder.svg"
  }
]
```

The `sugar_/protein_/sodium_/saturated_fat_/fiber_g_per_serving` fields are always
included so clients can see *why* an alternative was ranked where it was. Each
alternative also carries an `image_url` — the product's contributed image or the
shared placeholder (see [Product Image Upload](#28-product-image-upload-api)).

**Expected Error Response (404 Not Found or empty array):**
If the product does not exist, returns `404`. If no similar products with a higher score exist, returns `[]`.

### 6. Recent Scans API
This endpoint returns the last 5 scanned barcodes from memory.

- **URL:** `/recent`
- **Method:** `GET`

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/recent
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "recent": [
    "8901491101837",
    "8901030922896"
  ]
}
```

### 7. Health Check API
Liveness + readiness probe. Render polls this to decide whether an instance is
healthy (and restarts it if not), and it is the endpoint UptimeRobot monitors.

- **URL:** `/health`
- **Method:** `GET`

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "uptime_seconds": 86412.7,
  "uptime_human": "1d 0h 0m 12s",
  "started_at": "2026-07-12T15:37:35.628068+00:00",
  "server_time": "2026-07-13T15:37:48.310000+00:00",
  "database": "ok",
  "products_loaded": 252,
  "pid": 23180
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `status` | `"ok"`, or `"degraded"` if the database probe failed. |
| `uptime_seconds` / `uptime_human` | How long this worker has been alive. **This is the proof the service is not tied to a terminal** — poll it before and after closing your terminal (or shutting the laptop) and the number will have grown, not reset. |
| `started_at` | When the worker booted (UTC). |
| `database` | `"ok"` if SQLite is readable from this worker, else `"unavailable"`. |
| `products_loaded` | Row count in `products` — catches a booted-but-empty database. |
| `pid` | Worker process ID. With `--workers 2` you will see this alternate between two values across requests; if it *changes unexpectedly*, a worker was respawned. |

A failed database probe returns `status: "degraded"` with **HTTP 200**, not a 5xx —
deliberately, so a transient DB blip doesn't cause Render to kill an otherwise
healthy instance. Only a genuinely dead process fails the health check.

`status` is still `"ok"` in the normal case, so any existing caller checking that
field keeps working unchanged.

#### Lightweight ping — `/ping`

- **URL:** `/ping`
- **Method:** `GET`

Answers without touching the database, so a monitor polling every 5 minutes adds
essentially no load to the free tier. Use `/health` when you want the full picture,
`/ping` when you only need to know the process is answering.

#### Live product count — `/product-count`

Returns the **live** "Products available" figure for the frontend, counted from
the database on every request (never hard-coded).

- **URL:** `/product-count`
- **Method:** `GET`

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/product-count
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "curated_count": 252,
  "categories": 23,
  "by_category": {
    "chocolate": 48,
    "chips": 34,
    "soft_drink": 30,
    "juice": 20,
    "biscuit": 18,
    "...": "..."
  },
  "external_source": "Open Food Facts",
  "external_coverage": "on-demand",
  "total_coverage_note": "252 products are curated in Swapify's database; any other barcode is resolved live against Open Food Facts at scan time, so total reachable products also include that external catalogue.",
  "generated_at": "2026-07-17T20:51:15.895081+00:00"
}
```

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `curated_count` | **Live** row count of Swapify's curated `products` table — the headline "Products available" number. Reflects the real architecture, not a constant. |
| `categories` / `by_category` | Number of distinct categories and the per-category breakdown (also demonstrates the count is genuine). |
| `external_source` / `external_coverage` | Swapify also resolves any barcode **not** in the curated DB against Open Food Facts at scan time (`on-demand`), so total *coverage* is far larger than `curated_count`. |
| `total_coverage_note` | A ready-to-display sentence describing curated + external coverage. |
| `generated_at` | UTC timestamp the count was computed. |

Returns **HTTP 503** if the database is unreadable. Intended for the frontend's
"Products available" widget (share `curated_count` for the headline, and
optionally `total_coverage_note` for the "+ millions via Open Food Facts" line).

```json
{ "status": "ok", "uptime_seconds": 86412.7 }
```

### 8. Get Scan History API
This endpoint returns the last 5 scanned products for the authenticated user, sorted by scan time descending.

- **URL:** `/history`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>" "http://127.0.0.1:8000/history"
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**
```json
[
  {
    "barcode": "8901491101837",
    "product_name": "Lay's Classic Salted",
    "brand": "Lay's",
    "health_score": 6,
    "grade": "C",
    "image_url": null,
    "scanned_at": "2023-10-27 14:32:10"
  }
]
```

**Product names are never a placeholder — July 28 (Issue 2).** `scan_history` keeps
its own `product_name`/`health_score` snapshot taken at scan time. When the scanned
barcode has no row in `products` (the pack was resolved from Open Food Facts, or
scanned from the bundled offline CSV), the endpoint used to ignore that snapshot and
return the literal **`"Unknown Product"`** — which is how a scanned *Cadbury 5 Star*
appeared as an unknown product even though its name was recorded. It now falls back
in order: the `products` name → the scan-time snapshot → the brand → `"Scanned
product <barcode>"`. The stored `health_score` is returned too (with a derived
`grade`) instead of `null`.

The same fallback policy (`display_product_name` in `app.py`) now covers
`GET /favorites` and the `card.title` of `GET /share/{barcode}` — every endpoint
that renders a denormalised snapshot rather than a freshly resolved product. No API
response contains the string `"Unknown Product"` any more.

### 9. Report Missing Product API
This endpoint allows users to report a product that was not found in the database.

**Authentication is optional (July 27).** A shopper who scans an unknown pack can
report it whether or not they are signed in — requiring a valid token here was what
surfaced in the app as *"Backend Unreachable — could not submit the report."* When a
valid `Authorization` header is sent the report is credited to that user (an
`activity` log entry) and `authenticated` is `true` in the response. Reports are
**de-duplicated per barcode**, and a transient DB error returns a clean `503`
(never a dropped connection or a `500`).

- **URL:** `/report-missing`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>` *(optional)*
- **Request Body (JSON):**
  - `barcode` (required, string): The scanned barcode.
  - `product_name` (optional, string): The name of the product.
  - `comment` (optional, string): User's comment or additional info.

**Example using `curl` (anonymous):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/report-missing \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"barcode": "123456789", "product_name": "New Snacks", "comment": "Not in DB"}'
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "status": "reported",
  "barcode": "123456789",
  "already_reported": false,
  "authenticated": false
}
```

**Errors:** `400` when `barcode` is empty; `503` if the report can't be saved
(retryable).

### 10. Offline Products API
This endpoint returns the entire product database in a lightweight JSON response for offline caching.

- **URL:** `/offline-products`
- **Method:** `GET`

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/offline-products
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**
```json
[
  {
    "barcode": "8901491101837",
    "name": "Lay's Classic Salted",
    "brand": "Lay's",
    "nutrition": {
      "sugar": 0.3,
      "saturated_fat": 1.8,
      "sodium": 370.0,
      "protein": 2.0,
      "fiber": 1.0,
      "calories": 150.0
    },
    "score": 6,
    "grade": "C"
  }
]
```

### 11. Search Products API
This endpoint searches the products table by product name or brand, with optional
filtering by brand, category, health score and grade, and returns results sorted
healthiest-first by default.

**Barcode-aware search:** when `q` looks like a barcode (digits only, ≥ 8 chars),
the query is treated as a **barcode lookup** and is
[validated](#20-barcode-validation--correction-api) first. An invalid-but-correctable
barcode (e.g. a mistyped check digit) is **auto-corrected** to its suggestion for
the lookup, so the product is still found. Barcode matches include
`"matched_by": "barcode"` and a `barcode_validation` object; text (name/brand)
searches return the shape below.

- **URL:** `/search`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Query Parameters:** (all optional — combine any subset)
  - `q`: free text matched against `product_name` and `brand` (SQL `LIKE`), or a barcode.
  - `brand`: filter by brand (`LIKE`), e.g. `?brand=Maggi`.
  - `category`: filter by category (`LIKE`), e.g. `?category=chips`.
  - `min_score` / `max_score`: keep only products within this health-score range.
  - `grade`: keep only products with this letter grade (`A`–`F`).
  - `no_preservatives` / `no_artificial_colors` / `no_artificial_flavors` /
    `no_palm_oil` / `clean_label` (booleans, Feature 1): clean-label filters. A
    product is dropped only when the avoided additive is positively detected in its
    ingredient list; `clean_label=true` applies all four. When the request is
    authenticated, the user's **saved** clean-label preferences apply too (the
    query flags add to them).
  - `sort`: `score_desc` (default, healthiest first), `score_asc`, or `name`.
  - `limit`: 1–500 results per page (default 50).
  - `offset`: number of ranked results to skip, for pagination (default 0).
  - `external` (boolean, July 27): include Open Food Facts' global catalogue in
    text searches. Defaults to the `SWAPIFY_EXTERNAL_SEARCH` setting (on); pass
    `external=false` to search **only** our curated catalogue.

Each result item also carries `is_better_for_you` (Feature 2 — `true` when
`score ≥ 7`) and a **`source`** field — `"database"` for our curated catalogue or
`"openfoodfacts"` for a global-catalogue hit.

**Global catalogue (Open Food Facts) — July 27:** for a **text** search, results
from Open Food Facts are merged in after our own so a product we don't curate
(e.g. *"Mother Dairy"*) still appears in search instead of only when its barcode is
scanned. Our own DB rows come first and are never delayed by OFF; external hits are
appended best-effort (short timeout, cached ~5 min), de-duplicated by barcode, and
pass the very same score/grade/clean-label filters. Clicking an OFF result through
to [`GET /product/{barcode}`](#1-get-product-details-api) resolves it fully. This
uses OFF's [Search-a-licious](https://search.openfoodfacts.org) API — the legacy
`cgi/search.pl` endpoint is heavily rate-limited and often returns a 503 HTML page,
which is why name search previously "found nothing".

**Pagination:** results are scored, filtered and ranked, then the page is sliced
as `results[offset : offset + limit]`. For example `?limit=10&offset=0` is page 1
and `?limit=10&offset=10` is page 2. Each result includes an `image_url` — the
product's own uploaded image, or the shared placeholder
(`/product-images/_placeholder.svg`) when it has none (see
[Product Images](#28-product-image-upload-api)).

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
# Text search (healthiest first) — includes Open Food Facts products
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/search?q=mother+dairy"

# Our curated catalogue only (no external results)
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/search?q=lays&external=false"

# Filter: grade-A products in the "chips" category, cheapest-scoring first
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/search?category=chips&min_score=3&sort=score_desc&limit=5"

# Pagination — second page of 10
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/search?q=&sort=name&limit=10&offset=10"
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**
```json
[
  {
    "barcode": "8901491101837",
    "name": "Lay's Classic Salted",
    "brand": "Lay's",
    "category": "chips",
    "score": 6,
    "grade": "C",
    "is_better_for_you": false,
    "image_url": "/product-images/_placeholder.svg",
    "source": "database"
  }
]
```

#### Autocomplete (typeahead) — `/search/autocomplete`
Lightweight suggestions for a search box, returned as the user types. Matching is
word-level and punctuation-tolerant; **prefix** matches are ranked ahead of
mid-word matches. A blank query returns an empty list.

Suggestions come from the curated catalogue first and are then **topped up from
Open Food Facts** when our own rows can't fill the dropdown, so the search box
can reach products we don't curate ("nutella", "pringles") instead of only the
~250 seeded ones. Curated rows always keep the top slots and are never delayed by
OFF — if OFF is slow or unreachable, the catalogue half is returned on its own.

Each suggestion carries `source` (`"database"` or `"openfoodfacts"`); OFF rows
arrive already scored, so they also carry `score`, `grade` and
`is_better_for_you`. Catalogue rows omit those three (the typeahead index holds
no nutrition — clients score them locally or call `/product/{barcode}`).

- **URL:** `/search/autocomplete`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Query Parameters:**
  - `q` (required): the partial text typed so far.
  - `limit`: 1–10 suggestions (default 8).
  - `external`: include the Open Food Facts half. Defaults to the
    `SWAPIFY_EXTERNAL_SEARCH` setting; pass `external=false` for curated only.

The OFF top-up is skipped for queries shorter than
`SWAPIFY_AUTOCOMPLETE_EXTERNAL_MIN_CHARS` (default 3) so short prefixes stay
instant, and is bounded by `SWAPIFY_AUTOCOMPLETE_EXTERNAL_TIMEOUT` (default
2.5 s).

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/search/autocomplete?q=mag&limit=5"
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "query": "mag",
  "count": 3,
  "suggestions": [
    {"product_name": "Maggi noodles", "brand": "Maggi", "barcode": "8901058005783",
     "source": "database"},
    {"product_name": "Maggi masala",  "brand": "Maggi", "barcode": "8901058005784",
     "source": "database"},
    {"product_name": "Maggi Hot Heads", "brand": "Nestlé", "barcode": "8901058872231",
     "source": "openfoodfacts", "score": 3.5, "grade": "D", "is_better_for_you": false}
  ]
}
```

### 12. Dietary Preferences API
Save and retrieve a user's dietary preferences (Low Sugar, High Protein, Vegan,
…). These drive [Personalized Scoring](#personalized-scoring) and the
preference-aware [Better Alternatives](#5-similar-products-api-better-alternatives)
ranking. Requires authentication. Preferences are stored in the
`user_preferences` table (one row per user, JSON of boolean flags).

There are two kinds of preference. **Scoring** preferences re-weight the health
score; **clean-label** preferences (Feature 1) *filter* products out of results.

**Scoring preferences** (all optional booleans, default `false`):

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `low_sugar` | Sugar nutrient + "Sugars & Sweeteners" ingredient penalties weighted **×1.75**; lower-sugar alternatives ranked first. |
| `low_sodium` | Sodium penalties weighted **×1.75**; lower-sodium alternatives ranked first. |
| `low_fat` | Saturated-fat + "Oils & Fats" penalties weighted **×1.75**; lower-fat alternatives ranked first. |
| `high_protein` | Protein bonus weighted **×2.5**; higher-protein alternatives ranked first. |
| `high_fiber` | Fiber bonus weighted **×2.5**; higher-fiber alternatives ranked first. |
| `vegan` | Cancels dairy "Protein Quality" bonuses; non-vegan alternatives filtered out of `/similar`. |

**Clean-label preferences (Feature 1)** — these *filter* products in `/search`,
`/recommendations` and the home feed. A product is dropped only when the avoided
additive is **positively detected** in its ingredient list; a product with no
ingredient list is kept (absence of data is not proof of a violation).

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `no_preservatives` | Hide products with chemical preservatives (BHA, TBHQ, benzoates, INS 2xx …). |
| `no_artificial_colors` | Hide products with synthetic colours (tartrazine, sunset yellow, INS 1xx …). |
| `no_artificial_flavors` | Hide products listing artificial / synthetic flavourings. |
| `no_palm_oil` | Hide products containing palm oil / palmolein / palm fat. |
| `clean_label` | All four clean-label filters at once. |

Clean-label preferences can also be passed as query flags directly to
[`/search`](#11-search-products-api) (e.g. `?clean_label=true`), which is the
easiest way to demo them without saving preferences first.

#### Get Preferences
- **URL:** `/preferences`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):** every recognised flag is returned with a
stable shape (defaulting to `false`).
```json
{
  "user_id": 2,
  "preferences": {
    "low_sugar": true,
    "low_sodium": false,
    "low_fat": false,
    "high_protein": true,
    "high_fiber": false,
    "vegan": false,
    "no_preservatives": false,
    "no_artificial_colors": false,
    "no_artificial_flavors": false,
    "no_palm_oil": false,
    "clean_label": false
  }
}
```

#### Save Preferences
- **URL:** `/preferences`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- **Request Body (JSON):**
  - `preferences` (object): a map of the flags above. Unknown keys are ignored;
    values are coerced to booleans.

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/preferences \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"preferences": {"low_sugar": true, "high_protein": true}}'
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):** all recognised flags are echoed back. Saving
`{"clean_label": true}` alone, for example, returns it among the full set.

#### Update Preferences (legacy alias)
`POST /update-preferences` is kept for backwards compatibility and now **persists**
preferences (previously a no-op). It accepts either a flat body
(`{"low_sugar": true}`) or a wrapped body (`{"preferences": {...}}`) and returns
`{"status": "preferences updated", "preferences": {...}}`. New clients should use
`POST /preferences`.

### 12a. Available Preferences API
Lists every preference the app supports, with labels, types and descriptions, so a
client can render the toggles without hard-coding them (Feature 1). **No auth.**

- **URL:** `/preferences/available`
- **Method:** `GET`

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/preferences/available
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "count": 11,
  "preferences": [
    {"key": "low_sugar", "label": "Low Sugar", "type": "scoring", "description": "…"},
    {"key": "no_palm_oil", "label": "No Palm Oil", "type": "clean_label", "description": "…"},
    {"key": "clean_label", "label": "Clean Label", "type": "clean_label", "description": "…"}
  ],
  "scoring_preferences": ["low_sugar", "low_sodium", "low_fat", "high_protein", "high_fiber", "vegan"],
  "clean_label_preferences": ["no_preservatives", "no_artificial_colors", "no_artificial_flavors", "no_palm_oil", "clean_label"]
}
```

### 13. AI Nutritionist Chatbot API
A **real LLM-powered** nutritionist (not rule-based) that answers free-text
questions about packaged foods, grounded in food science and in the product's
own data. It integrates with **free AI APIs** — **OpenRouter** (many free-tier
models) as the primary provider, with **Google Gemini** as an optional automatic
failover — so a rate-limited free tier still returns a genuine AI answer.

It is built to answer five kinds of questions:
1. **Product ingredients and their risks** — e.g. *"What ingredients here are
   risky and why?"* (uses the product's flagged ingredients and risk levels).
2. **Health scores and why** — e.g. *"Why did this get such a low score?"* The
   product's **actual score breakdown** (base score, each penalty/bonus, category
   caps, transparency multiplier) **and** a summary of the scoring methodology are
   passed to the model, so it explains the real math instead of guessing.
3. **Ingredient substitutions** — e.g. *"What can I use instead of sugar?"* (see
   below).
4. **Top picks from the catalogue** — e.g. *"What are the top picks from all
   products?"* or *"best chocolates"* (see **Structured top picks** below).
5. **General nutrition & food-transparency** questions — e.g. *"Why do vague
   ingredient labels matter?"* (works with no barcode).

When a `barcode` is supplied, the product's nutrition, ingredients, health score,
flagged ingredients **and score breakdown** are passed to the model as grounding
context.

#### Structured formatting (Fix 3A)
Replies are **structured Markdown**, not one plain block: a bold headline, then
sections such as **Key Highlights**, **Why it scored this way** and **Healthier
Alternative**, using bullet points and short sections. The frontend renders the
Markdown (headers, lists, bold/italic) into styled HTML. This holds whether the
answer comes from the LLM or, when no AI key is configured, from the deterministic
rule-based fallback — the fallback now emits the same structured shape.

#### Product lookup by name (Fix 3B)
A product **named in the question** is resolved from the catalogue even with no
barcode scanned:
- *"Frooti score"*, *"is Maggi healthy?"* → the product is looked up by name/brand
  and its score, ingredients and per-100g nutrition ground the answer. A named
  product takes precedence over whatever was last scanned. The response then has
  `product_in_database: true` and `resolved_by: "name"`.
- If the question is clearly about a specific product but it **isn't** in the
  database, the bot doesn't answer generically — it returns a short guidance reply
  ("You can scan the barcode of this product using the scanner to get all the
  details and score"), with `product_in_database: false` and `source:
  "product-lookup"`.

> **Keyword weighting (July 27).** Every keyword found in the question is ranked by
> how *identifying* it is — a full product name or brand outranks a longer but
> generic descriptor word — so *"Kellogg's Multigrain Chocos"* resolves to
> **"Chocos cereal"** instead of an unrelated *"…multigrain…chips"* (the old logic
> let the single longest word win). Generic grain/label adjectives
> (`multigrain`, `wholegrain`, …) are excluded from the lookup index.
>
> When a product-info question resolves to a product, the deterministic fast-path
> answers directly from our scored data (`source: "fast-path-deterministic"`) and
> now returns `product_name`, `score`, `grade` and `ingredient_flags` alongside the
> Markdown `response`, so the client can render the score card without a second call.

#### Greeting fast-path (performance)
A bare greeting or smalltalk message (`"hi"`, `"hello"`, `"thanks"`, `"how are
you"`, …) with no barcode is answered **instantly from a canned welcome — the LLM
is never called**. This is what keeps a one-word "hi" at a few **milliseconds**
instead of the multi-second (previously ~25s) round-trip a free-tier model + its
failover chain would otherwise cost. Such a response has `source: "fast-path"`.
The match is conservative: anything beyond a plain greeting (e.g. *"hi, is Maggi
healthy?"*) still goes to the AI. Provider HTTP timeouts are also lowered and
configurable (`OPENROUTER_TIMEOUT` / `GEMINI_TIMEOUT`, default 12s) so a slow
model fails over sooner.

#### Structured top picks (7+ rule)
When the question asks for the best/top/healthiest products (*"what are the top
picks from all products"*, *"best chocolates"*, *"healthiest noodles"*), the
endpoint answers **from the real scored catalogue**, not with a generic
paragraph. It scores every product with the same engine the Home page and product
pages use and applies the **7+ rule** — a genuinely good, "Swapify Recommended"
pick scores **≥ 7/10** (grade A/B). The matched picks are:
1. passed to the LLM as grounding so the prose cites the actual products, and
2. returned as a structured **`top_picks`** array (each item has `barcode`,
   `product_name`, `brand`, `category`, `score`, `grade`, `recommended` and the
   key nutrients), plus a `top_picks_category` field naming the applied filter
   (or `null` for all products).

A category can be inferred from the question (*"best chocolates"* → the
`chocolate` category). If **no** product clears the 7+ bar (this catalogue is
packaged snacks), the array is **never empty** — it returns the highest-scoring
products instead, each flagged `recommended: false`, and the prose says so
honestly.

#### Ingredient Substitution Suggestions
When the question asks **what to use instead of an ingredient** — e.g. *"What can
I use instead of sugar?"* — the endpoint detects the substitution intent and the
named ingredient, looks up **healthier, food-science-backed alternatives** from a
curated knowledge base (cross-referenced with the beneficial ingredients in the
database: natural sweeteners, healthy oils, whole grains, …), and:
1. passes those suggestions to the LLM as grounding context (so the prose answer
   is accurate and not hallucinated), and
2. also returns them as a structured **`substitutions`** array in the response.

A few of the swaps covered: sugar → jaggery / dates / stevia / honey; palm oil →
cold-pressed / olive / rice-bran oil; maida → whole-wheat flour / oats / millets;
MSG → tomato / mushroom / herbs; artificial colours → turmeric / beetroot / paprika.

- **URL:** `/chat`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Request Body (JSON):**
  - `question` (required, string): The user's question.
  - `barcode` (optional, string): A product barcode to use as context.

#### Configuration & rate-limit handling
Set at least one provider key in `server/.env` (see "How to run the backend"):

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` | Primary provider. Free key: https://openrouter.ai/keys |
| `OPENROUTER_MODEL` | Primary model (default `openai/gpt-oss-120b:free`). |
| `OPENROUTER_FALLBACK_MODELS` | Comma-separated models tried in order if the primary is busy. |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | Optional second provider. Free key: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey |
| `GEMINI_MODEL` | Gemini model (default `gemini-2.0-flash`). |
| `OPENROUTER_TIMEOUT` | Per-request OpenRouter HTTP timeout in seconds (default `12`). Lower = faster failover when a model hangs. |
| `GEMINI_TIMEOUT` | Per-request Gemini HTTP timeout in seconds (default `12`). |

**Free-tier rate limits are handled gracefully.** Free models are frequently
rate-limited (HTTP 429). The backend:
- tries each OpenRouter model **in order**; a per-model 429 **skips immediately to
  the next model** (no wasted retry), other transient errors get one quick retry;
- **fails over to Gemini** when configured and every OpenRouter model is busy;
- stops calling OpenRouter at once if the **account-wide daily cap** is hit;
- only if **all** providers fail does it fall back to a deterministic,
  food-science answer (so the endpoint always returns `200`, never `500`).

The `source` field reports which provider answered (`"openrouter"`, `"gemini"`,
or `"fallback"`) and `model` reports the exact model used.

**Example using `curl` (why this score — grounded in the real breakdown):**
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/chat \

      "date": "2023-10-26",
      "average_score": 7.5
    }
  ]
}
```

### 16. Monthly Health Report API (`/monthly-report`)
Generate a **monthly summary report** from a user's scan history. The report
aggregates a single calendar month of scans into total scans, average health
score, the best- and worst-scoring products scanned, the **score trend** across
the month, and a **most-scanned category breakdown**.

- **URL:** `/monthly-report`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Headers (optional):** `Authorization: Bearer <token>` — used as the user when
  `user_id` is not supplied; also personalizes the scores.
- **Query Parameters:**
  - `user_id` (int): Whose history to summarise. Required unless an
    `Authorization` token is sent (the token's user is then used).
  - `month` (optional, string `YYYY-MM`): The month to report on. **Defaults to
    the current (UTC) month.**

**How values are computed:**
- **`total_scans`** — number of scans recorded in the month.
- **`average_score`** — mean health score across those scans (personalized to the
  user's dietary preferences, like the other user-scoped endpoints).
- **`best_product` / `worst_product`** — the highest- and lowest-scoring products
  scanned in the month.
- **`score_trend`** — compares the average score of the **first half** of the
  month's scans against the **second half** (chronological): `improving` when the
  later half is ≥ 0.5 higher, `declining` when ≥ 0.5 lower, else `stable`
  (`no_data` when there are no scans).
- **`category_breakdown`** — scan count per product category, most-scanned first.

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
# Explicit user and month
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/monthly-report?user_id=2&month=2026-06"

# Authenticated user, current month (month defaults)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>" "http://127.0.0.1:8000/monthly-report"
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "user_id": 2,
  "month": "2026-06",
  "total_scans": 8,
  "average_score": 4.6,
  "best_product": {

    "barcode": "8901058005783",
    "product_name": "Maggi noodles",
    "brand": "Maggi",
    "score": 1.0,

    {"category": "chocolate", "count": 1}
  ],
  "daily_trends": [
    {"date": "2026-06-05", "average_score": 2.5},
    {"date": "2026-06-20", "average_score": 6.7}
  ]
}
```

**Response when the user has no scans in the month (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "user_id": 2,
  "month": "2026-01",
  "total_scans": 0,
  "average_score": 0,
  "best_product": null,
  "worst_product": null,
  "score_trend": "no_data",
  "category_breakdown": [],
  "daily_trends": []
}
```

**Expected Error Responses (400 Bad Request):**
```json
{ "detail": "user_id is required (query param or Authorization token)" }
```
```json
{ "detail": "month must be in YYYY-MM format" }
```

*(Note: These endpoints can be easily tested in your browser by simply pasting the URL in the address bar if you do not want to use `curl`).*

### 17. Crowdsourced Product Ratings API

Let users rate products on **taste**, **quality** and **value** (each **1-5
stars**) alongside the objective health score, and read the community's average
ratings for a product.

Ratings are stored per **(user, product)**: a user re-rating the same barcode
**updates** their existing rating (they never stack), so community averages are
never double-counted. Each rating row stores `user_id`, `barcode`,
`taste_rating`, `quality_rating`, `value_rating` and a `rated_at` timestamp.

#### Submit / Update a Rating
- **URL:** `/rate-product`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (required)
- **Request Body (JSON):**
  - `barcode` (required, string): The product being rated.
  - `taste_rating` (required, int 1-5)
  - `quality_rating` (required, int 1-5)
  - `value_rating` (required, int 1-5)

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/rate-product" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"barcode":"8908013479122","taste_rating":5,"quality_rating":4,"value_rating":4}'
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "message": "Rating submitted",
  "barcode": "8908013479122",
  "rating": {
    "taste_rating": 5,
    "quality_rating": 4,
    "value_rating": 4
  }
}
```
> On a repeat rating of the same product the `message` becomes `"Rating updated"`.

**Error Responses:**
```json
{ "detail": "taste_rating must be an integer from 1 to 5" }   // 400 – star out of range
```
```json
{ "detail": "Invalid token" }                                  // 401 – missing/invalid auth
```

#### Get a Product's Average Ratings
- **URL:** `/product/{barcode}/ratings`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Auth:** Not required (public).

Returns the average `taste`, `quality` and `value` ratings, an `overall`
average (mean of the three), and the `total_ratings` count.

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/product/8908013479122/ratings"
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "barcode": "8908013479122",
  "total_ratings": 2,
  "average_ratings": {
    "taste": 3.0,
    "quality": 4.0,
    "value": 3.0,
    "overall": 3.33
  }
}
```
> When a product has no ratings yet, `total_ratings` is `0` and each average is
> `null`.

#### Get the Current User's Ratings
- **URL:** `/user/ratings`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (required)

Returns the authenticated user's own past ratings, newest first. `product_name`
and `brand` are included when the product is in the local catalog.

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "user_id": 15,
  "total": 2,
  "ratings": [
    {
      "barcode": "8901491101837",
      "product_name": "Lay's Classic Salted",
      "brand": "Lay's",
      "taste_rating": 3,
      "quality_rating": 2,
      "value_rating": 3,
      "overall_rating": 2.67,
      "rated_at": "2026-07-02 15:55:04"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 18. AI-Powered Product Recommendations API

A **rule-based personalized recommendation engine**. For a logged-in user it
blends three interest signals with the health score and crowdsourced ratings:

1. **Scan history** — the user's most-scanned product categories.
2. **Dietary preferences** — the saved flags (`high_protein`, `low_sugar`,
   `vegan`, …). Scores are personalized and clearly non-vegan products are
   dropped for vegan users.
3. **Past comparisons viewed** — categories of products the user has compared
   (`/compare`, `/compare-multiple`) are logged and used as an interest signal.

Community ratings give a small boost/penalty, the personalized health score is
the base desirability signal, and already-scanned products are de-prioritized so
recommendations favour fresh discoveries. **5-10** products are returned, each
with a human-readable `reason`.

- **URL:** `/recommendations`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Headers (optional):** `Authorization: Bearer <token>` — used as the user
  when `user_id` is not supplied.
- **Query Parameters:**
  - `user_id` (optional, int): Whom to recommend for. Falls back to the
    authenticated user. **If neither is supplied, generic popular products are
    returned.**
  - `limit` (optional, int): Number of recommendations, **clamped to 5-10**
    (default `10`).

Each recommendation includes: `barcode`, `product_name`, `brand`,
`health_score`, `grade`, and `reason`.

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
# Personalized (explicit user_id)
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/recommendations?user_id=15"

# Personalized (via token)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>" "http://127.0.0.1:8000/recommendations"

# Generic popular products (anonymous)
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/recommendations"
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK) — personalized:**
```json
{
  "user_id": 15,
  "personalized": true,
  "count": 10,
  "based_on": {
    "top_categories": ["bar"],
    "dietary_preferences": { "high_protein": true },
    "comparisons_considered": true
  },
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "barcode": "8906068720018",
      "product_name": "Max chocolate protein bar",
      "brand": "Max protein bar",
      "health_score": 6.5,
      "grade": "C",
      "image_url": "/product-images/_placeholder.svg",
      "reason": "Recommended because it matches your most-scanned category (bar) and is high in protein."
    }
  ]
}
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK) — anonymous (generic popular):**
```json
{
  "user_id": null,
  "personalized": false,
  "count": 10,
  "recommendations": [
    {
      "barcode": "8908013479122",
      "product_name": "The whole truth food protein bar",
      "brand": "The whole truth",
      "health_score": 5.0,
      "grade": "C",
      "image_url": "/product-images/_placeholder.svg",
      "reason": "Recommended because it is popular with other shoppers."
    }
  ]
}
```

### 19. Shareable Score Card API

Return a product's data **formatted for a shareable image card**. Bundles the
identity fields, the health score/grade, **key warnings** and flagged
ingredients, plus a ready-to-render `card` block (grade colour, headline, labels)
so the frontend can draw the card without re-deriving any copy.

- **URL:** `/share/{barcode}`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Headers (optional):** `Authorization: Bearer <token>` — personalizes the
  score to the user's dietary preferences when present.

The product is resolved from the local catalog first, then Open Food Facts
(whose products also supply an `image_url`; local products have `image_url:
null`). **Key warnings** are derived from the nutrition (high sugar / sodium /
saturated fat per serving) and any High/Severe-risk flagged ingredients.

**Response fields:** `barcode`, `product_name`, `brand`, `image_url`,
`health_score`, `grade`, `warnings`, `ingredient_flags`, and a `card` object
(`title`, `subtitle`, `score_label`, `grade`, `grade_color`, `headline`,
`warning_count`, `flag_count`, `footer`).

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/share/7622300441937"
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "barcode": "7622300441937",
  "product_name": "Cadbury Dairy Milk",
  "brand": "Cadbury",
  "image_url": null,
  "health_score": 1.5,
  "grade": "F",
  "warnings": [
    "High sugar (57.0g per serving)",
    "High saturated fat (19.6g per serving)",
    "Contains sugar (high risk)",
    "Contains fractionated fat (high risk)"
  ],
  "ingredient_flags": [
    { "name": "sugar", "risk": "High" },
    { "name": "fractionated fat", "risk": "High" }
  ],
  "card": {
    "title": "Cadbury Dairy Milk",
    "subtitle": "Cadbury",
    "score_label": "1.5/10",
    "grade": "F",
    "grade_color": "#d73027",
    "headline": "Cadbury Dairy Milk scores 1.5/10 (grade F) — worth a closer look.",
    "warning_count": 4,
    "flag_count": 2,
    "footer": "Scanned with Swapify"
  },
  "source": "database"
}
```

**Error Response (404 Not Found):**
```json
{ "error": "Product not found" }
```

### 20. Barcode Validation & Correction API

Validate a barcode's **length** and **check digit** and, when it's invalid,
return a **suggested correction**. Supports the standard retail formats —
**EAN-8** (8 digits), **UPC-A** (12 digits) and **EAN-13** (13 digits) — whose
final digit is a GS1 modulo-10 check digit computed from the preceding digits.

This validation is also woven into
[`/product/{barcode}`](#1-get-product-details-api) (a `barcode_validation` object
is attached when the barcode is malformed, including on the `404`) and
[`/search`](#11-search-products-api) (a barcode-looking query is auto-corrected
for the lookup).

- **URL:** `/validate-barcode/{barcode}`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Auth:** Not required (public).

**Response fields:**
- `barcode` (string): the trimmed input.
- `valid` (bool): `true` only for a well-formed barcode with a correct check digit.
- `format` (string|null): the detected format (`EAN-8` / `UPC-A` / `EAN-13`), or `null`.
- `suggestion` (string|null): a corrected barcode when one can be derived, else `null`.
- `message` (string): a human-readable explanation.

**Correction logic:**
- **Right length, wrong check digit** → suggests the same digits with the correct
  check digit.
- **One digit short of a format** (e.g. **12 digits** → EAN-13) → suggests the code
  with a **check digit added**.
- **Contains non-digits** → suggests the digits-only form when that is itself valid.

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
# Valid
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/validate-barcode/8901491101837"

# Invalid check digit -> suggestion
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/validate-barcode/8901491101830"
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK) — valid:**
```json
{
  "barcode": "8901491101837",
  "valid": true,
  "format": "EAN-13",
  "suggestion": null,
  "message": "Valid EAN-13 barcode."
}
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK) — invalid, with correction:**
```json
{
  "barcode": "8901491101830",
  "valid": false,
  "format": "EAN-13",
  "suggestion": "8901491101837",
  "message": "Invalid EAN-13 check digit: expected '7', got '0'. Suggested correction: '8901491101837'."
}
```

### 21. User Activity Logging API

Track user actions — **scan**, **compare**, **share**, **rate**, **favorite** —
to understand behaviour and improve recommendations. Each action is stored in the
`user_activity` table with `user_id`, `action_type`, an optional `barcode`, an
optional JSON `metadata` blob and a `created_at` timestamp.

The `/product`, `/compare`, `/compare-multiple`, `/share`, `/rate-product` and
`POST /favorites` endpoints also **auto-log** (best-effort) the matching action
for logged-in users, so the activity stream and trends reflect real usage without
the client having to log anything explicitly.

**Recognised `action_type` values:** `scan`, `compare`, `share`, `rate`, `favorite`.

#### Log an Activity
- **URL:** `/activity`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Headers (optional):** `Authorization: Bearer <token>` — when present, its user
  is used; otherwise `user_id` is taken from the body.
- **Request Body (JSON):**
  - `action_type` (required, string): one of the recognised values above.
  - `user_id` (optional, int): used when the request is not authenticated.
  - `barcode` (optional, string): the product the action relates to (if any).
  - `metadata` (optional, object): free-form extra context (stored as JSON).

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/activity \
-H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_TOKEN>" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"action_type":"scan","barcode":"8901491101837","metadata":{"src":"scanner"}}'
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "message": "Activity logged",
  "activity": {
    "id": 42,
    "user_id": 2,
    "action_type": "scan",
    "barcode": "8901491101837",
    "metadata": { "src": "scanner" },
    "created_at": "2026-07-04 08:24:39"
  }
}
```

**Expected Error Response (400 Bad Request):** unknown `action_type`.
```json
{ "detail": "action_type must be one of: scan, compare, share, rate, favorite" }
```

#### Get a User's Activity History
- **URL:** `/activity/user/{user_id}`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Auth:** Not required.
- **Query Parameters:**
  - `action_type` (optional, string): filter to a single action type.
  - `limit` (optional, int): max rows, **clamped to 1–200** (default `50`).

Returns the user's activity newest-first plus an `action_counts` summary.

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "user_id": 2,
  "count": 4,
  "action_counts": { "scan": 3, "rate": 1 },
  "activities": [
    {
      "id": 42,
      "user_id": 2,
      "action_type": "scan",
      "barcode": "8901491101837",
      "metadata": { "src": "scanner" },
      "created_at": "2026-07-04 08:24:39"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Get Overall Activity Trends *(optional analytics)*
- **URL:** `/activity/trends`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Auth:** Not required.
- **Query Parameters:**
  - `days` (optional, int): size of the day-by-day window, **clamped to 1–90**
    (default `7`).

Returns the total number of actions, a breakdown **by action type**, a per-day
count for the last `days` days, the most-active barcodes, and the number of
distinct active users in the window.

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "window_days": 7,
  "total_actions": 8,
  "by_action_type": { "scan": 4, "share": 1, "rate": 1, "favorite": 1, "compare": 1 },
  "by_day": [ { "date": "2026-07-04", "count": 8 } ],
  "top_barcodes": [ { "barcode": "8901491101837", "count": 3 } ],
  "active_users": 1
}
```

### 22. Daily Digest / Notification API

Generate a **daily summary** of a user's scans to build engagement — designed to
be dropped straight into an **email or push-notification** pipeline. Summarises a
single day's scans into **total scans**, **average score**, and the **best** and
**worst** product scanned, and returns ready-to-send `notification` and `email`
blocks. Scores use the user's personalized dietary weights.

- **URL:** `/digest/{user_id}`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Headers (optional):** `Authorization: Bearer <token>` — personalizes the scores.
- **Query Parameters:**
  - `date` (optional, string `YYYY-MM-DD`): the day to summarise. **Defaults to the
    current (UTC) day.**

**Manual trigger vs. scheduling:** this `GET` endpoint **is** the manual trigger.
For automated daily delivery, schedule a job that calls it once a day and forwards
the `notification` / `email` blocks to your provider, e.g. a **cron** entry
(`0 8 * * * curl -s http://127.0.0.1:8000/digest/2`) or a **Windows Task
Scheduler** task running the same `curl`.

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
# Today's digest
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/digest/2"

# A specific day
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/digest/2?date=2026-07-04"
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "user_id": 2,
  "date": "2026-07-04",
  "total_scans": 3,
  "average_score": 2.7,
  "best_product": {
    "barcode": "8908013479122",
    "product_name": "The whole truth food protein bar",
    "brand": "The whole truth",
    "score": 5.0,
    "grade": "C"
  },
  "worst_product": {
    "barcode": "8901491101837",
    "product_name": "Lay's Classic Salted",
    "brand": "Lay's",
    "score": 1.1,
    "grade": "F"
  },
  "notification": {
    "type": "daily_digest",
    "title": "Your daily scan summary — 3 scans",
    "body": "You scanned 3 products today with an average health score of 2.7/10. Best: The whole truth food protein bar (5.0/10, C). Watch out for: Lay's Classic Salted (1.1/10, F)."
  },
  "email": {
    "subject": "Your Swapify daily digest — avg 2.7/10 across 3 scans",
    "preview": "3 scans · avg 2.7/10",
    "body_text": "You scanned 3 products today with an average health score of 2.7/10. Best: The whole truth food protein bar (5.0/10, C). Watch out for: Lay's Classic Salted (1.1/10, F)."
  }
}
```

**Response when the user has no scans that day (200 OK):** a friendly nudge.
```json
{
  "user_id": 2,
  "date": "2026-07-04",
  "total_scans": 0,
  "average_score": 0,
  "best_product": null,
  "worst_product": null,
  "notification": {
    "type": "daily_digest",
    "title": "No scans yet today",
    "body": "You haven't scanned any products today. Scan a product to see how healthy it is and get better recommendations!"
  },
  "email": {
    "subject": "Your Swapify daily digest",
    "preview": "You haven't scanned any products today. Scan a product to see how healthy it is and get better recommendations!",
    "body_text": "You haven't scanned any products today. Scan a product to see how healthy it is and get better recommendations!"
  }
}
```

**Expected Error Response (400 Bad Request):** malformed `date`.
```json
{ "detail": "date must be in YYYY-MM-DD format" }
```

### 22a. Weekly Digest Email API (Feature 3)
A once-a-week summary **email**: the week's scans (count, average score, best /
worst pick), the user's favourites, their challenge progress and a couple of "try
next" recommendations. Templating, delivery and unsubscribe live in the standalone
[`weekly_digest.py`](weekly_digest.py) module; the cron runner is
[`cron_weekly_digest.py`](cron_weekly_digest.py).

**Delivery is pluggable and degrades gracefully:**
- `SENDGRID_API_KEY` set → send via the SendGrid v3 HTTP API.
- `SMTP_HOST` (+ optional `SMTP_USER` / `SMTP_PASSWORD`) → send via SMTP.
- neither set → **dry-run**: the rendered `.eml` is written to `EMAIL_OUTBOX`
  (default `./outbox/`) and logged, so the feature works with no credentials.

**Subscription** state lives in the `email_preferences` table (default: subscribed).
Every email carries a one-click unsubscribe link with a **signed** token
(HMAC-SHA256 over the user id with `SECRET_KEY`), so it works from an email client
with no login and cannot be forged for another user.

#### Preview the digest (data + rendered email)
- **URL:** `/weekly-digest/{user_id}` · **Method:** `GET`

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/weekly-digest/2
```
Returns `{ "digest": {…scans, favourites, challenges, recommendations…}, "email":
{ "subject", "html", "text", "provider" }, "subscribed", "unsubscribe_url" }`.
Nothing is sent.

#### Send this user's digest now
- **URL:** `/weekly-digest/{user_id}/send` · **Method:** `POST`

Honours the unsubscribe flag (an opted-out user is not emailed). Returns
`{ "sent": true, "provider": "outbox", "to": "…", "detail": "…" }`.

#### Send to all subscribers (the cron target)
- **URL:** `/admin/send-weekly-digests` · **Method:** `POST`
- **Headers:** `X-Admin-Token: <ADMIN_TOKEN>` (403 without it)
- **Query:** `limit` (optional, cap the batch — handy for testing).

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/send-weekly-digests" \
  -H "X-Admin-Token: $ADMIN_TOKEN"
# -> {"sent": 12, "skipped": 3, "failed": 0, "provider": "outbox", "total_users": 15, ...}
```
Schedule it weekly (crontab or Windows Task Scheduler — see
[`cron_weekly_digest.py`](cron_weekly_digest.py)):
```cron
0 8 * * 1  cd /path/to/swapify && python cron_weekly_digest.py >> digest.log 2>&1
```

#### Email subscription preferences (auth)
- `GET /email-preferences` → `{ "user_id", "weekly_digest": true|false }`
- `POST /email-preferences` with `{"weekly_digest": false}` → toggle off/on.

#### Unsubscribe (one-click, no login)
- **URL:** `/unsubscribe?token=<signed-token>` · **Method:** `GET`

Returns a small HTML confirmation page and flips the user's subscription off. An
invalid/forged token is rejected (`400`) without changing anything.

### 23. Weekly Challenges & Leaderboard API

A **gamification** layer: users join **weekly challenges** and see where they
**rank** against everyone else on the **leaderboard**. Progress is derived from
the existing `user_activity` stream (scans, comparisons and ratings are already
auto-logged), so **joining a challenge is the only new write** — nothing about
the scan/compare/rate flows changes. Completing a challenge earns its **badge**,
which is shown on the leaderboard.

**The four active challenges (seeded automatically):**

| # | Title | Counts | Target | Badge |
|---|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| 1 | Scan 20 products this week | `scan` actions | 20 | Scan Champion |
| 2 | Find 5 products with score > 4 | distinct scanned products scoring > 4 | 5 | Health Hunter |
| 3 | Compare 10 products | `compare` actions | 10 | Comparison Pro |
| 4 | Rate 15 products | `rate` actions | 15 | Star Reviewer |

Progress is measured over each challenge's rolling **period** window (weekly =
last 7 days). The tables are created and seeded on server startup
(`app.ensure_feature_schema`) — see also
`migrations/005_create_challenges_reviews_smartcart.sql`.

#### Get Active Challenges
- **URL:** `/challenges`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Headers (optional):** `Authorization: Bearer <token>` — when supplied, each
  challenge also carries whether the user has `joined` it and their live
  `progress`.

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/challenges"                              # anonymous
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/challenges" -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>"  # with my progress
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):** *(authenticated — note `joined`/`progress`)*
```json
{
  "count": 4,
  "active_challenges": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "code": "scan_20_weekly",
      "title": "Scan 20 products this week",
      "description": "Scan any 20 products within a week to complete this challenge.",
      "goal_type": "scan",
      "target": 20,
      "score_threshold": null,
      "period": "weekly",
      "badge": "Scan Champion",
      "participant_count": 3,
      "joined": true,
      "joined_at": "2026-07-06 14:32:12",
      "progress": { "current": 3, "target": 20, "completed": false, "percent": 15.0, "remaining": 17 }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Join a Challenge
- **URL:** `/challenges/{id}/join`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (required)

Idempotent — re-joining returns the existing entry with `message: "Already joined"`.

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/challenges/1/join" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>"
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "message": "Joined challenge",
  "challenge_id": 1,
  "title": "Scan 20 products this week",
  "badge": "Scan Champion",
  "joined": true,
  "progress": { "current": 0, "target": 20, "completed": false, "percent": 0.0, "remaining": 20 }
}
```
**Error (404):** `{ "detail": "Challenge not found" }`

#### Get My Progress in a Challenge
- **URL:** `/challenges/{id}/progress`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (required)

Progress is computed live from the activity stream. When the target is reached
the participant row is stamped `completed_at` (badge earned — sticky thereafter).

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/challenges/1/progress" -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>"
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "challenge_id": 1,
  "title": "Scan 20 products this week",
  "description": "Scan any 20 products within a week to complete this challenge.",
  "badge": "Scan Champion",
  "period": "weekly",
  "joined": true,
  "joined_at": "2026-07-06 14:32:12",
  "completed_at": null,
  "badge_earned": false,
  "current": 3,
  "target": 20,
  "completed": false,
  "percent": 15.0,
  "remaining": 17
}
```

#### Get the Leaderboard
- **URL:** `/leaderboard`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Auth:** Not required (public).
- **Query Parameters:**
  - `period` (optional): `weekly` (7d, default), `monthly` (30d) or `all-time`.
  - `limit` (optional, default 10, max 100).

Users are ranked by an **activity score** — a weighted sum of their actions in
the period (`scan` = 1, `compare` = 3, `rate` = 2, `share` = 1, `favorite` = 1).
Each row shows `rank`, `username`, `score`, an action `breakdown` and the
`badges` the user has earned from completed challenges.

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/leaderboard?period=weekly&limit=10"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/leaderboard?period=all-time"
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "period": "weekly",
  "count": 2,
  "scoring": { "scan": 1, "compare": 3, "rate": 2, "share": 1, "favorite": 1 },
  "leaderboard": [
    {
      "rank": 1,
      "user_id": 23,
      "username": "tester_1783154991",
      "score": 15,
      "activity_count": 10,
      "activity_breakdown": { "scan": 5, "compare": 1, "rate": 3, "favorite": 1 },
      "badges": ["Scan Champion"],
      "badge_count": 1
    }
  ]
}
```
**Error (400):** `{ "detail": "period must be one of: weekly, monthly, all-time" }`

### 24. Smart Cart — Shopping List Optimization API

Let a user build a **shopping list** of products and get **healthier
alternatives** for each item. Optimization reuses the same personalized "better
alternatives" engine as `/similar`: for every item it returns the original plus
its **top 2 healthier same-category alternatives** (higher score / better
nutrition). Lists are saved, fetchable and deletable, and an item can be
**replaced** by a chosen alternative.

Items are referenced by **barcode**. When the request is authenticated the list
is tied to the user and the scores/alternatives are personalized to their
dietary preferences (and non-vegan swaps are dropped for vegan users).

#### Create a Shopping List
- **URL:** `/shopping-list`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Headers (optional):** `Authorization: Bearer <token>` — ties the list to the
  user and personalizes scores.
- **Request Body (JSON):**
  - `items` (required, string[]): product barcodes (trimmed & de-duplicated).
  - `name` (optional, string): defaults to `"My Shopping List"`.

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/shopping-list" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name":"Weekly Groceries","items":["8901262176224","8904335602385","8901491101837"]}'
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "message": "Shopping list created",
  "id": 1,
  "user_id": 28,
  "name": "Weekly Groceries",
  "created_at": "2026-07-06 14:32:59",
  "item_count": 3,
  "items": [
    {
      "barcode": "8901262176224",
      "product_name": "Chocobar",
      "brand": "Amul",
      "category": "bar",
      "score": 2.0,
      "grade": "F",
      "sugar_g": 9.2,
      "protein_g": 1.7,
      "sodium_mg": 50.0,
      "saturated_fat_g": 7.7,
      "fiber_g": 0.0,
      "found": true
    }
  ]
}
```
**Error (400):** `{ "detail": "items must contain at least one barcode" }`

#### Get a Saved Shopping List
- **URL:** `/shopping-list/{id}`
- **Method:** `GET`

Returns the saved list with each item scored (same item shape as above).
**Error (404):** `{ "error": "Shopping list not found" }`

#### Optimize a Shopping List
- **URL:** `/shopping-list/{id}/optimize`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Headers (optional):** `Authorization: Bearer <token>` — personalizes the ranking.

For each item returns the `original` plus its top 2 `alternatives`, the
`best_alternative_score` and the `potential_gain` (best alternative score minus
the original's). A list-level summary reports how many items have a healthier
option and the `total_potential_gain`.

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/shopping-list/1/optimize" -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>"
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "list_id": 1,
  "name": "Weekly Groceries",
  "item_count": 3,
  "items_with_alternatives": 3,
  "total_potential_gain": 7.9,
  "items": [

      "potential_gain": 3.0,
      "has_healthier_option": true
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Replace an Item
- **URL:** `/shopping-list/{id}/replace`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Request Body (JSON):** `old_barcode` (string), `new_barcode` (string).

Swaps one item's barcode (e.g. for a healthier alternative) and returns the
updated, re-scored list.

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/shopping-list/1/replace" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"old_barcode":"8901262176224","new_barcode":"8908013479122"}'
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**
```json
{ "message": "Replaced 8901262176224 with 8908013479122", "id": 1, "item_count": 3, "items": [ ... ] }
```
**Error (404):** `{ "detail": "'8901262176224' is not in this list" }`

#### Delete a Shopping List
- **URL:** `/shopping-list/{id}`
- **Method:** `DELETE`

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://127.0.0.1:8000/shopping-list/1"
```
**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):** `{ "message": "Shopping list deleted", "list_id": 1 }`

### 25. Community Reviews & Discussions API

Let users leave **written reviews** (free text + a **1-5 star rating**) on a
product and **discuss** them with **upvotes/downvotes** and **threaded replies**.
A review is distinct from the structured taste/quality/value ratings in
`/rate-product` — this is the free-text discussion layer. A user can delete
**only their own** review; deleting a review cascades to its votes and replies.

#### Submit a Review
- **URL:** `/reviews`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (required)
- **Request Body (JSON):**
  - `barcode` (required, string)
  - `rating` (required, int 1-5)
  - `review_text` (required, string)

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/reviews" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"barcode":"8901491101837","rating":4,"review_text":"Great crunch but too salty for daily snacking."}'
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "message": "Review submitted",
  "review": {
    "id": 1,
    "user_id": 29,
    "username": "rv1_1783348415",
    "barcode": "8901491101837",
    "rating": 4,
    "review_text": "Great crunch but too salty for daily snacking.",
    "created_at": "2026-07-06 14:33:36",
    "upvotes": 0,
    "downvotes": 0,
    "vote_score": 0,
    "replies": [],
    "reply_count": 0
  }
}
```
**Error (400):** `{ "detail": "rating must be an integer from 1 to 5" }`

#### Get a Single Review
- **URL:** `/reviews/{id}`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Auth:** Not required.

Returns the review with its vote counts and replies (see the `review` shape
above). **Error (404):** `{ "error": "Review not found" }`

#### Get All Reviews for a Product
- **URL:** `/product/{barcode}/reviews`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Auth:** Not required.

Returns every review for the product (newest first), plus the `total_reviews`
and the `average_rating`.

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/product/8901491101837/reviews"
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**

#### Delete a Review (own only)
- **URL:** `/reviews/{id}`
- **Method:** `DELETE`
- **Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (required)

Deletes the review **and** its votes and replies. Only the author may delete it.

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://127.0.0.1:8000/reviews/1" -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>"
```
**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):** `{ "message": "Review deleted", "review_id": 1 }`
**Error (403):** `{ "detail": "You can only delete your own review" }`

#### Upvote / Downvote a Review *(optional feature)*
- **URL:** `/reviews/{id}/vote`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (required)
- **Request Body (JSON):** `vote` — `"up"` or `"down"`.

Re-voting updates the user's existing vote; voting the same direction twice
**removes** it (toggle). Returns the review's updated vote tally.

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/reviews/1/vote" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"vote":"up"}'
```
**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**
```json
{ "message": "Vote recorded", "review_id": 1, "upvotes": 1, "downvotes": 0, "vote_score": 1 }
```
**Error (400):** `{ "detail": "vote must be 'up' or 'down'" }`

#### Reply to a Review *(optional feature)*
- **URL:** `/reviews/{id}/replies`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (required)
- **Request Body (JSON):** `reply_text` (string).

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/reviews/1/replies" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"reply_text":"Agreed, the sodium is high."}'
```
**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "message": "Reply added",
  "reply": { "id": 1, "user_id": 30, "reply_text": "Agreed, the sodium is high.", "created_at": "2026-07-06 14:33:37", "username": "rv2_1783348415" }
}
```

### 26. Personalized Home Feed API
One call that assembles everything the app's **home screen** needs: the user's
recently scanned products, personalized recommendations, the featured weekly
challenge with progress, and the badges they've earned.

- **URL:** `/home-feed`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Query Parameters:**
  - `user_id` (optional): whose feed to build. Falls back to the authenticated
    user (`Authorization: Bearer <token>`) when omitted.
- **Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (optional — an alternative to `user_id`).

**Behaviour**

| Caller | `logged_in` | Content |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Known user (`user_id` **or** token) | `true`  | last 5 **distinct** scanned products, personalized recommendations, the joined weekly challenge closest to completion (with live progress), and earned badges. |
| Anonymous (neither) | `false` | generic **popular products**, default recommendations, a **preview** of the first weekly challenge (`progress: null`), and no badges. |

**Returned fields**
- `recently_scanned` — up to 5 distinct products (most recent first), each with `barcode`, `product_name`, `brand`, `score`, `grade`, `image_url` (plus `category`, `health_score` and `scanned_at` for convenience). For anonymous callers this is drawn from the shared in-memory recent scans (see `/recent`).
- `recommendations` — same engine as [`/recommendations`](#18-ai-powered-product-recommendations-api) (personalized for a known user, popular for anonymous), each with `barcode`, `product_name`, `brand`, `score`, `grade`, `reason` and `image_url`.
- `challenge_progress` — the featured weekly challenge condensed to `{challenge_name, progress, target}`. `progress` is `0` for an anonymous preview. `null` when there is no active weekly challenge.
- `badges_earned` — the badges the user has won, each `{name, icon, earned_at}` (empty for anonymous). `earned_at` is the date the badge was first completed.

Every product image is guaranteed present: products without an image return the shared placeholder (`/product-images/_placeholder.svg`).

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
# Personalized (via token)
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/home-feed" -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>"

# Personalized (via explicit user_id)
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/home-feed?user_id=48"

# Generic (anonymous)
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/home-feed"
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "user_id": 48,
  "logged_in": true,
  "personalized": true,
  "recently_scanned": [
    {"barcode": "8901491101837", "product_name": "Lay's Classic Salted", "brand": "Lay's", "score": 1.1, "grade": "F", "image_url": "/product-images/8901491101837.png"}
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    {"barcode": "8906068720018", "product_name": "Max chocolate protein bar", "brand": "Max protein bar", "score": 5.0, "grade": "C", "reason": "Recommended because it matches your most-scanned category (bar) and is a healthy choice.", "image_url": "/product-images/_placeholder.svg"}
  ],
  "challenge_progress": {
    "challenge_name": "Scan 20 products this week",
    "progress": 12,
    "target": 20
  },
  "badges_earned": [
    {"name": "Health Hunter", "icon": "🔍", "earned_at": "2026-07-08"}
  ]
}
```

> **Note:** `recently_scanned` items also include `category`, `health_score` and
> `scanned_at`, and each response carries `user_id`, `logged_in` and
> `personalized` metadata — supersets of the fields above.

### 27. "Swapify Recommended" Badge API
Determines whether a product qualifies for the **Swapify Recommended** badge — a
clean, genuinely healthy pick.

**Criteria**

| Criterion | Requirement | Blocks the badge? |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| `health_score_above_7` | Health score **> 7** | ✅ Yes |
| `no_high_risk_ingredients` | No **Severe** or **High** [risk](#ingredient-risk-levels) flagged ingredients | ✅ Yes |
| `no_artificial_colors` | No synthetic colours (named dyes or INS/E **1xx** codes) | ✅ Yes |
| `no_preservatives` | No chemical preservatives (named, or INS/E **2xx** codes) | ⚪ Optional (reported only) |

A product is `is_recommended: true` only when all three **required** criteria pass.
Preservative-free is reported for transparency but, per spec, does **not** block
the badge on its own.

**Integration with `/product`:** every [`GET /product/{barcode}`](#1-get-product-details-api)
response now includes `is_recommended` (boolean) and a `recommended_badge` object
with the full criteria breakdown.

- **URL:** `/product/{barcode}/badge`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (optional — personalizes the score, and therefore the badge, to the user's dietary preferences).

Resolves the product from the local DB first, then Open Food Facts. Returns `404`
with `{"error": "Product not found"}` when the barcode can't be resolved anywhere.

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/product/8908013479122/badge"
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "barcode": "8908013479122",
  "product_name": "The whole truth food protein bar",
  "brand": "The whole truth",
  "grade": "C",
  "source": "database",
  "is_recommended": false,
  "badge": null,
  "health_score": 5.0,
  "criteria": {
    "health_score_above_7": false,
    "no_high_risk_ingredients": true,
    "no_artificial_colors": true,
    "no_preservatives": true
  },
  "required_criteria": ["health_score_above_7", "no_high_risk_ingredients", "no_artificial_colors"],
  "failing_criteria": ["health_score_above_7"],
  "high_risk_ingredients": [],
  "has_artificial_colors": false,
  "has_preservatives": false
}
```

When a product **does** qualify, `is_recommended` is `true`, `badge` is
`"Swapify Recommended"` and `failing_criteria` is empty.

### 27a. "Better For You" Badge (Feature 2)
A lighter, purely score-driven badge — distinct from the stricter *Swapify
Recommended* badge above (which also requires no high-risk ingredients and no
artificial colours). **Any product scoring 7 or higher** earns it.

There is no separate endpoint: the flag is attached to product and list responses
so cards and detail pages can render it directly:
- **Product detail** (`GET /product/{barcode}`, `GET /score/{barcode}`):
  `is_better_for_you` (bool) and `better_for_you_badge`
  (`{ "is_better_for_you", "label", "threshold": 7.0, "score" }`).
- **Lists** (`/search`, `/products/by-category/{category}`, `/recommendations`,
  `/home-feed` recently-scanned): each item carries `is_better_for_you`.

```json
{ "is_better_for_you": true,
  "better_for_you_badge": {"is_better_for_you": true, "label": "Better For You", "threshold": 7.0, "score": 7.5} }
```

---

### 28. Product Image Upload API
Crowdsourced product images. Anyone can contribute a photo for a product; the
uploader is recorded when the request is authenticated. The image bytes are
stored on disk and served back under the `/product-images` static prefix — only
the **URL reference** is stored in the database (on `products.image_url` and in
the `product_images` table).

Every product-returning endpoint (`/product/{barcode}`, `/search`, `/similar`,
`/home-feed`, `/recommendations`) now includes an `image_url`. Products without a
contributed image return the shared **placeholder**
(`/product-images/_placeholder.svg`), so the client never renders an empty box.

- **URL:** `/product/image`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Content-Type:** `multipart/form-data`
- **Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <token>` (optional — records the uploader).
- **Form fields:**
  - `barcode` (required): the product barcode the image is for.
  - `file` (required): the image file.
- **Validation:**
  - Format must be **JPEG or PNG** (sniffed from the file's magic bytes, not just
    the declared `Content-Type`) → otherwise `400`.
  - Size must be **under 2 MB** → otherwise `413`.
  - Empty file or missing barcode → `400`.

On success the product's `image_url` is updated (when the product is in the local
catalogue) and the [product cache](PERFORMANCE.md#c-in-memory-caching) is
invalidated, so the new image appears on the very next read.

**Example using `curl`:**
```bash
# Upload a PNG for a product (authenticated)
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/product/image" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" \
  -F "barcode=8901491101837" \
  -F "file=@lays.png;type=image/png"

# Then fetch the served image
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/product-images/8901491101837.png" --output lays.png
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "message": "Image uploaded successfully",
  "barcode": "8901491101837",
  "image_url": "/product-images/8901491101837.png",
  "product_updated": true,
  "file_size": 40213,
  "content_type": "image/png"
}
```

**Error responses**
| Status | When |
|--------|------|
| `400` | Not a JPEG/PNG, empty file, or missing `barcode`. |
| `413` | Image exceeds the 2 MB limit. |

### 29. OCR Label Scanner API (Proof of Concept)

Upload a photo of a product's **ingredient/nutrition label**; the server runs it
through **Tesseract OCR** ([`ocr_label_scanner.py`](src/ocr_label_scanner.py)),
extracts the ingredient list and any nutrition facts, and feeds them into the
**same scoring engine** used for catalogue products — so a label alone yields a
health score, grade and flagged ingredients, **no barcode required**.

> **Proof of concept.** OCR is an *optional* dependency (Tesseract engine +
> `pytesseract` + `Pillow`). When it isn't installed the endpoints report so and
> the rest of the API is unaffected. See [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](DEPLOYMENT.md) §9.

#### Check OCR availability
- **URL:** `/ocr/health`
- **Method:** `GET`
- **Response:**
  ```json
  { "ocr_available": true, "detail": "Tesseract 5.3.3 ready" }
  ```

#### Scan a label
- **URL:** `/ocr/scan-label`
- **Method:** `POST`
- **Body:** `multipart/form-data` with an image `file` (JPEG/PNG, ≤ 2 MB).

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/ocr/scan-label" \
  -F "file=@label.jpg;type=image/jpeg"
```

**Expected JSON Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "message": "Label scanned",
  "raw_text": "Ingredients: Sugar, Maida, Palm Oil, ...",
  "ingredients": ["Sugar", "Maida", "Palm Oil", "Milk Solids", "TBHQ", "Tartrazine"],
  "ingredients_text": "Sugar, Maida, Palm Oil, Milk Solids, TBHQ, Tartrazine",
  "nutrition": { "sugar_g_per_serving": 56.2, "sodium_mg_per_serving": 120.0, "protein_g_per_serving": 6.5 },
  "score": 1.0,
  "grade": "F",
  "rule_version": 1,
  "ingredient_flags": [
    { "name": "sugar", "risk": "High" },
    { "name": "tbhq", "risk": "Severe" },
    { "name": "tartrazine", "risk": "High" }
  ],
  "breakdown": { "...": "full score breakdown" }
}
```

**Error responses**
| Status | When |
|--------|------|
| `400` | Not a JPEG/PNG, or empty file. |
| `413` | Image exceeds the 2 MB limit. |
| `503` | OCR engine not installed (see `GET /ocr/health`). |

---

## Performance & Optimization

The API applies several optimizations (indexes, query trimming + pagination,
in-memory caching, and gzip compression). These are documented in full in
[`PERFORMANCE.md`](PERFORMANCE.md). In short:

- **Indexes** on `products(barcode, product_name, brand, category)` and a
  composite `(product_name, brand)` index, created idempotently at startup.
- **Query optimization**: `/search` selects only the columns it needs (no
  `SELECT *`) and supports `limit` + `offset` pagination.
- **Caching** (`cachetools.TTLCache`, 1-hour TTL): generic product detail scores
  and the top-100 popular-products list, invalidated on update (e.g. image
  upload). ~12× faster on a warm cache locally.
- **Gzip** compression on responses over 500 bytes.

**Benchmark it:** run [`perf_test.py`](perf_test.py) for a before/after
measurement of the search indexes (`python perf_test.py`). On a 40k-row synthetic
catalogue the `product_name` lookup is **~600× faster** with the index
(`EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` shows `SCAN` → `SEARCH ... USING INDEX`); the script also
verifies the indexes exist and are used on the real `swapify.db`.

---

## Ingredient Risk Levels

Every harmful ingredient is classified into one of four **risk levels**. These are
stored in the database in the `ingredient_rules.risk_level` column (migration
`migrations/002_add_ingredient_risk_level.sql`, populated by
`add_ingredient_risk_levels.py`) and are the single source of truth — the API reads
them at scoring time and returns them in the `ingredient_flags` array of the
`/product`, `/score`, `/v2/score` and `/chat` responses.

| Risk Level | Meaning | Examples |
|------------|---------|----------|
| **Severe** | Banned / strongly linked to harm | TBHQ, Sodium Nitrite, Sodium Nitrate, Potassium Bromate, BHA, Partially Hydrogenated / Vanaspati (trans-fats) |
| **High**   | Refined / strongly discouraged | Maida, Refined Sugar, HFCS, Tartrazine, Sunset Yellow, Titanium Dioxide, Aspartame |
| **Medium** | Consume in moderation | Palm Oil, MSG, Sodium Benzoate, Maltodextrin, Sucralose, Caramel Color IV |
| **Low**    | Low-concern additives | Potassium Sorbate, Natural Flavour, Artificial Flavour |

**`ingredient_flags` format:**
```json
"ingredient_flags": [
  {"name": "sugar", "risk": "High"},
  {"name": "palm oil", "risk": "Medium"},
  {"name": "maida", "risk": "High"},
  {"name": "msg", "risk": "Medium"},
  {"name": "tbhq", "risk": "Severe"}
]
```

Beneficial ingredients (e.g. oats, whey protein) are not assigned a risk level and
do not appear in `ingredient_flags`.

### 30. Real-World Experiment Logging API

An append-only log of scans performed by real test devices in the field, plus the
analytics computed over it. Built for the "does this actually work in a shop, on a
real phone?" experiments.

**Why it is separate from the other logs.** `scan_history` is a side effect of a
successful `/product/{barcode}` lookup (catalogue products only), and `/activity`
records in-app behaviour for a *logged-in* user. An experiment log has to accept a
scan from an anonymous phone, record barcodes that aren't in the catalogue (a
failed scan is the most interesting data point), and stay stable no matter how the
product endpoints change. So it gets its own table, `experiment_scan_logs`.

| Endpoint | Auth | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `POST /experiment/log-scan` | none (optional Bearer) | Record one scan from a test device |
| `GET /experiment/logs` | **admin** | Retrieve the log, filtered + paginated |
| `GET /experiment/analytics` | **admin** | Just the counts, without the rows |

#### Admin authentication

The two read endpoints are admin-only — the log is a device-level record. Prove
admin in **either** of two ways:

1. **Shared secret** — send the `X-Admin-Token` header. The value comes from the
   `ADMIN_TOKEN` environment variable.
   ```bash
   curl -H "X-Admin-Token: $ADMIN_TOKEN" "$BASE/experiment/logs"
   ```
2. **Admin user** — log in normally and send the JWT as `Authorization: Bearer
   <token>`. This works only if that user's email is listed in the `ADMIN_EMAILS`
   env var (comma-separated).
   ```bash
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT" "$BASE/experiment/logs"
   ```

Anything else gets **403**. If `ADMIN_TOKEN` is not set the app falls back to the
dev token `swapify-admin-dev` and logs a warning at startup — never deploy that.

#### A. Log a scan — `POST /experiment/log-scan`

Deliberately open: a phone in a shop aisle is not logged in. If a Bearer token
*is* present the scan is additionally attributed to that user.

**Request body**

| Field | Type | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `barcode` | string | **yes** | The scanned code. Not validated against the catalogue — failed/unknown scans are exactly what an experiment wants to capture. |
| `device_type` | string | no | One of `mobile`, `tablet`, `desktop`, `scanner`, `unknown`. **Auto-detected from the User-Agent when omitted.** Common synonyms (`phone`, `android`, `ios`, `ipad`, `laptop`, `pc`) are folded into the canonical buckets; anything unrecognised becomes `unknown` rather than being rejected. |
| `device_info` | string *or* object | no | Free-form. A plain string (`"iPhone 14, iOS 17.4"`) or a JSON object (`{"os":"Android 14","model":"Pixel 8"}`). Objects are stored as JSON and returned as objects. |
| `timestamp` | string (ISO-8601) | no | When the scan happened on the device. Defaults to server time. Normalised to UTC on write, so a phone in another timezone still lands in the right day bucket. An unparseable value falls back to server time (and is logged) rather than failing the request. |
| `device_id` | string | no | Stable per-device ID — this is what `unique_devices` counts. When omitted, a fingerprint is derived by hashing `device_info` + User-Agent. **Send a real `device_id` if you can:** two identical phones with byte-identical User-Agents will otherwise collapse into one device. |
| `notes` | string | no | Free-text field note, e.g. `"aisle 4, poor lighting"`. |

The minimum viable call is just a barcode — everything else is inferred:

```bash
curl -X POST "$BASE/experiment/log-scan" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"barcode": "8901491101837"}'
```

```json
{
  "message": "Scan logged",
  "log": {
    "id": 1,
    "barcode": "8901491101837",
    "device_type": "mobile",
    "device_info": null,
    "device_id": "fp_05f02457b0badcfa",
    "user_id": null,
    "notes": null,
    "timestamp": "2026-07-13T15:38:59.712171+00:00",
    "created_at": "2026-07-13 15:38:59"
  }
}
```

`device_type` came out as `mobile` because the request carried an iPhone
User-Agent. A fully explicit call from a known device:

```bash
curl -X POST "$BASE/experiment/log-scan" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
        "barcode": "8901491101837",
        "device_type": "phone",
        "device_id": "dev-pixel-01",
        "device_info": {"os": "Android 14", "browser": "Chrome", "model": "Pixel 8"},
        "timestamp": "2026-07-12T09:15:00Z",
        "notes": "aisle 4, store test"
      }'
```

`"phone"` is normalised to `"mobile"`, and the `Z` timestamp is stored as
`2026-07-12T09:15:00+00:00`.

**Errors:** `400` if `barcode` is missing or empty.

#### B. Retrieve the log — `GET /experiment/logs` *(admin)*

Newest first. All query parameters are optional:

| Param | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `start_date` | — | Inclusive `YYYY-MM-DD`. |
| `end_date` | — | Inclusive — `end_date=2026-07-13` covers through 23:59:59 on the 13th. |
| `device_type` | — | Same buckets and synonyms as the write path, so `?device_type=phone` works. |
| `barcode` | — | Exact match — every scan of one product. |
| `limit` | `100` | Clamped to 1–500. |
| `offset` | `0` | For paging. |

A malformed date returns **400** (`start_date must be in YYYY-MM-DD format`)
rather than silently matching nothing.

```bash
curl -H "X-Admin-Token: $ADMIN_TOKEN" \
  "$BASE/experiment/logs?device_type=mobile&start_date=2026-07-01&end_date=2026-07-13&limit=50"
```

```json
{
  "filters": { "start_date": "2026-07-01", "end_date": "2026-07-13", "device_type": "mobile", "barcode": null },
  "pagination": { "limit": 50, "offset": 0, "returned": 2, "matched": 2, "has_more": false },
  "analytics": {
    "total_scans": 2,
    "unique_devices": 2,
    "unique_barcodes": 1,
    "scans_by_device_type": { "mobile": 2 },
    "top_barcodes": [ { "barcode": "8901491101837", "scans": 2 } ],
    "scans_per_day": [ { "date": "2026-07-12", "scans": 1 }, { "date": "2026-07-13", "scans": 1 } ]
  },
  "logs": [
    {
      "id": 2,
      "barcode": "8901491101837",
      "device_type": "mobile",
      "device_info": { "os": "Android 14", "browser": "Chrome", "model": "Pixel 8" },
      "device_id": "dev-pixel-01",
      "user_id": null,
      "notes": "aisle 4, store test",
      "timestamp": "2026-07-12T09:15:00+00:00",
      "created_at": "2026-07-13 15:38:59"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that `analytics` is computed over the **filtered** set, not the whole table —
so "mobile scans in the first half of July" reports its own totals, and
`pagination.matched` tells you how many rows matched regardless of `limit`.

#### C. Analytics — `GET /experiment/analytics` *(admin)*

The same three headline counts required for the experiment, without dragging back
thousands of rows to render them. Takes the identical filters as `/experiment/logs`.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `total_scans` | Rows matching the filter. |
| `unique_devices` | Distinct `device_id` values (see the fingerprint caveat above). |
| `unique_barcodes` | Distinct products scanned. |
| `scans_by_device_type` | Scan count per device bucket. |
| `top_barcodes` | Ten most-scanned barcodes, descending. |

### 31. Product Categories API (Feature 4)
Backend support for the frontend categories page. Every product carries a
consistent `category` (derived by the shared
[`category_taxonomy.guess_category`](src/category_taxonomy.py) at seed time). **No
auth.**

#### List categories
- **URL:** `/products/categories` · **Method:** `GET`
- **Query Parameters:**
  - `external` (boolean, July 28): include the Open Food Facts half of the counts.
    Defaults to the `SWAPIFY_EXTERNAL_SEARCH` setting (on); pass `external=false`
    for our curated counts only.

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/products/categories
```
```json
{
  "count": 24,
  "total_products": 181105,
  "db_products": 255,
  "external_products": 180850,
  "external_source": "openfoodfacts",
  "counts_pending": 0,
  "categories": [
    {"category": "chocolate", "label": "Chocolate", "count": 10049, "db_count": 49,
     "external_count": 10000, "external_count_known": true, "external_count_capped": true},
    {"category": "dairy_drink", "label": "Dairy Drink", "count": 7754, "db_count": 8,
     "external_count": 7746, "external_count_known": true},
    {"category": "milkshake", "label": "Milkshake", "count": 191, "db_count": 5,
     "external_count": 186, "external_count_known": true}
  ]
}
```
Ordered by product count (largest first). `label` is a display-friendly form of
the category id (`soft_drink` → `Soft Drink`).

**Counts are Open Food Facts' real numbers — July 30 (Task 3).** `count` =
`db_count` (our curated rows) + `external_count`, where `external_count` is now
queried from Open Food Facts' search index for that category and cached for
`SWAPIFY_CATEGORY_COUNT_TTL` (6 h). It used to be
`SWAPIFY_CATEGORY_EXTERNAL_LIMIT` — **our own fetch cap** — which is exactly why
the categories section reported a few hundred products for a database of millions.
The total went from ~385 to ~181,000 browsable products on the same catalogue.

Two things to know about the numbers:

- `external_count_capped: true` means the category holds **more** than Open Food
  Facts' search index will report (`SWAPIFY_OFF_RESULT_WINDOW`, 10,000), so read
  that count as "10,000 or more".
- `external_count_known: false` (and a non-zero `counts_pending`) means OFF could
  not be reached in time for that tile. `external_count` is then `0` — so
  `count == db_count + external_count` always holds — and the real number appears
  on a later request: the count requests keep running and warm the cache. The
  endpoint fans them out in parallel under one deadline
  (`SWAPIFY_CATEGORY_COUNT_DEADLINE`, 6 s) rather than blocking the grid.

Categories we can browse on OFF but curate nothing for still get a tile.
`external=false` restores DB-only counts.

#### Products in a category (paginated, scored)
- **URL:** `/products/by-category/{category}` · **Method:** `GET`
- **Query Parameters:**
  - `sort`: `score_desc` (default, healthiest first), `score_asc`, or `name`.
  - `limit`: 1–500 per page (default 50). · `offset`: skip N for pagination over
    the **whole** category — our rows first, then Open Food Facts'.
  - `external` (boolean, July 27): include Open Food Facts' global catalogue for
    this category. Defaults to the `SWAPIFY_EXTERNAL_SEARCH` setting (on); pass
    `external=false` for our curated list only.

**Global catalogue (Open Food Facts) — July 27:** so a category page isn't capped at
our ~250 curated rows, Open Food Facts products for the category are appended (via
[Search-a-licious](https://search.openfoodfacts.org), mapped through
`_OFF_CATEGORY_TAGS`), scored with the same engine and de-duplicated by barcode
against our own rows. Each product carries a `source` (`"database"` or
`"openfoodfacts"`), and the response reports `external_count` (OFF rows in *this
page*) alongside `external_total` (OFF rows in the category).

**No cap on depth — July 30 (Task 3).** Two fixes:

1. **The category filter was silently ignored.** `categories_tags` was being sent
   to Search-a-licious as its own request parameter, which the API accepts and then
   drops: a request for `en:biscuits` came back with grated carrots and tinned
   pears, and the only reason pages looked roughly right is that the `q` alongside
   it was a plain text search for the category label. The filter now goes inside
   `q` as Lucene syntax (`categories_tags:"en:biscuits"`) — verified 20/20 hits
   correctly tagged, vs 18/20 for the text search — which is also what makes an
   exact count possible.
2. **Browsing addresses OFF directly.** `limit`/`offset` are translated into an
   Open Food Facts page and fetched on demand, instead of merging a pre-fetched
   buffer of 200 and paginating *that*. `offset=5000` really does return OFF's
   5,000th biscuit. `total` is `db_total` + OFF's real count for the category, and
   `external_total_capped: true` marks a category deeper than
   `SWAPIFY_OFF_RESULT_WINDOW` (10,000 — OFF's search index will not page past it).

Underlying OFF pages are `SWAPIFY_OFF_PAGE_SIZE` (100) products and cached for
`SWAPIFY_CATEGORY_EXTERNAL_TTL` (30 min), so any `limit`/`offset` combination
reuses the same cache entries and only the first visitor to a page pays the ~1–2 s
fetch. `other` is the taxonomy's "no known peers" bucket, not a real category, so it
stays DB-only (and correctly returns rows whose `category` is empty).

**Sorting trade-off.** `sort` ranks our curated rows as a whole — they come first —
while the Open Food Facts rows that follow keep OFF's own ordering and are sorted
within the returned page. Ranking millions of external products globally would mean
downloading them all first; this is the trade for being able to browse the whole
catalogue.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/products/by-category/protein_bar?limit=2"
```
```json
{
  "category": "protein_bar",
  "label": "Protein Bar",
  "total": 4062,
  "db_total": 10,
  "external_total": 4052,
  "external_count": 0,
  "count": 2,
  "limit": 2,
  "offset": 0,
  "has_more": true,
  "products": [
    {"barcode": "8908013479122", "product_name": "The whole truth food protein bar",
     "brand": "The whole truth", "category": "protein_bar", "score": 6.1, "grade": "C",
     "recommended": false, "is_better_for_you": false,
     "nutrition_per_100g": {"basis": "per_100g", "serving_size_g": 52.0, "sugar": 0.0, "protein": 25.0, "fiber": 8.5, "…": "…"},
     "image_url": "/product-images/_placeholder.svg", "source": "database"}
  ]
}
```
Paging past our own rows serves Open Food Facts:

```bash
# our 10 curated protein bars, then OFF's 4,052 — offset 1000 is OFF's page 11
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8000/products/by-category/protein_bar?limit=5&offset=1000"
```

An unknown/empty category returns `total: 0` and an empty `products` array.
`external_total` is `null` when Open Food Facts could not be reached.

## Health Scoring Logic (V2)

The `/v2/score/{barcode}` API uses a rule-based scoring system to evaluate product
health on a scale of 1.0 to 10.0.

> **Spec compliance.** This engine implements
> [`ScoringLogic_Swapify.md`](ScoringLogic_Swapify.md) (Chandrika's two-sided
> ingredient risk/benefit framework). Every value below — the base score, position
> multipliers, category caps, transparency multipliers, all §3 ingredient
> deductions, all §4 additions, the §3.7 sodium %RDA bands and the §4.1/4.2/4.4
> per-100g stacking bonuses — matches that document. This is enforced by
> [`test_scoring_spec.py`](test_scoring_spec.py) (100 assertions, incl. the spec's
> two §6 worked examples): run `python test_scoring_spec.py`.
>
> **One documented extension:** the spec's negative sections are ingredient-based,
> but ~96% of the catalogue has a nutrition panel and **no** ingredient list — a
> purely ingredient-driven score would leave every sugary drink at the neutral 5.0
> baseline. So the engine adds nutrient-panel **sugar** and **saturated-fat**
> penalties (alongside the spec's own §3.7 sodium %RDA penalty). They pool into the
> spec's *Sugars & Sweeteners* / *Oils & Fats* categories and share the spec 2.4
> caps, so they never exceed what the spec allows.

### Formula

```
Final Score = (5.0 - Negative Deductions + Positive Additions) x Transparency Multiplier
```

The result is clamped to the range **1.0 – 10.0**.

**Worked examples (spec §6), reproduced by the engine:**

| Product | Ingredients | Engine score | Spec |
|---------|-------------|--------------|------|
| Instant noodles | Maida, Palm oil, Salt, MSG, TBHQ, Sodium benzoate, Tartrazine | **1.0 (F)** | ~1.4 |
| Protein multigrain biscuit | Whole wheat flour, Oats, Pea protein isolate, Jaggery, Cold-pressed oil | **9.1 (A)** | ~8.4 |

The two sit far apart — the spec's core credibility claim. (Small differences from
the spec's hand-worked figures come from the engine following the §2.3 position
table exactly and applying the §4.5/4.8 clean-label / whole-food bonuses; the
spread and grades match.)

> **One engine, both sides (Fix 2).** Every backend endpoint scores through a
> single function (`calculate_health_score_v2`), and the frontend's client-side
> scorer (used for offline / CSV-driven cards) was rewritten to mirror it exactly —
> same thresholds, per-100g bonuses, caps, transparency and 1–10 clamp — so a
> product scores identically in a CSV list and when scanned. The client catalogue
> CSV is regenerated from the database ([`export_products.py`](export_products.py))
> so both sides read the same data. (Products with an ingredient list are always
> resolved through the backend on scan, since the full 86-rule ingredient engine is
> authoritative.)

#### 1. Nutrient Penalties (per serving)
- **Sugar:** ≥10g (−2), 5–10g (−1)
- **Sodium** (%RDA of 2000 mg): >30% i.e. >600mg (−1.0), 15–30% i.e. 300–600mg (−0.6)
- **Saturated Fat** (sliding scale): ≥20g (−2.0), 10–20g (−1.5), 6–10g (−1.0), 3–6g (−0.5)

#### 1b. Nutrient Bonuses (per 100g)
Normalised via `serving_size_g` before the threshold is checked:
- **Protein:** ≥10g per 100g (+0.6)
- **Fiber:** ≥5g per 100g (+0.5)
- **Sugar:** <5g per 100g (+0.5)

Sugar, saturated-fat and sodium nutrient penalties are pooled into the same
categories as ingredients (Sugars & Sweeteners, Oils & Fats, Sodium) and share
their caps (see step 3).

> **Display basis (Fix 1).** Scoring reads the stored *per-serving* nutrition, but
> product responses also expose a `nutrition_per_100g` block and the UI displays
> nutrition **per 100g**, so a 200 ml drink no longer shows its full-serving
> numbers under a "per 100g" heading. See [Get Product Details](#1-get-product-details-api).

### 2. Ingredient Penalties & Position Multipliers
Each ingredient keyword is penalized (or rewarded) and multiplied by its position
in the list:
- **Top 3 ingredients:** x1.5
- **Middle (4th–8th):** x1.0
- **9th onward / trace (index >= 8):** x0.5

**Ingredient penalties (base, before multiplier):**
- **Oils & Fats:** palm oil (-0.6), fractionated fat (-0.7)
- **Refined Carbohydrates:** maida / refined wheat flour (-0.5)
- **Sodium:** salt (-0.6)
- **Flavor Enhancers:** msg (-0.5)
- **Preservatives:** tbhq (-0.8), sodium benzoate (-0.6)
- **Artificial Colors:** tartrazine (-0.7)
- **Sugars & Sweeteners:** sugar (-0.8), corn syrup (-0.6)

**Positive additions (base, before multiplier):**
- **Healthy Fats:** peanuts (+0.4)
- **Protein Quality:** skimmed milk (+0.5), milk solids (+0.5)

Detected harmful ingredients are returned in the `ingredient_flags` list.

### 3. Category Caps (maximum deduction per category)
Caps apply to the **combined** ingredient + nutrient penalty for each category:
- Oils & Fats: -2.5
- Sugars & Sweeteners: -2.5
- Preservatives: -2.0
- Artificial Colors: -2.0
- Sodium: -2.0
- Caffeine & Stimulants: -2.0
- Flavor Enhancers: -1.5
- Emulsifiers & Stabilizers: -1.5
- Other Additives: -1.5
- Refined Carbohydrates: -1.0

Positive additions are **not** capped.

### 4. Transparency Multiplier
Applied to the subtotal before the final clamp:
- **Vague** (contains 'flavouring', 'permitted emulsifier', 'spices', 'edible vegetable oil', etc.): **x0.95**
- **Disclosed** (additives named with INS/E numbers and no vague terms): **x1.05**
- **Default** (no ingredient list / nothing special): **x1.0**

### 5. Final Grade
The clamped score (1.0 – 10.0) maps to a grade:
- **A:** 9.0 – 10.0
- **B:** 7.0 – 8.9
- **C:** 5.0 – 6.9
- **D:** 3.0 – 4.9
- **F:** 1.0 – 2.9

### Worked example — Cadbury Dairy Milk (`7622300441937`)

| Source | Item | Position | Mult | Points |
|--------|------|----------|------|--------|
| Ingredient | Sugar | 1 | x1.5 | -1.20 |
| Ingredient | Fractionated Fat | 5 | x1.0 | -0.70 |
| Nutrient | Sugar (57g) | – | x1.0 | -2.00 |
| Nutrient | Saturated Fat (19.6g) | – | x1.0 | -1.00 |
| Addition | Milk Solids | 2 | x1.5 | +0.75 |

- Sugars & Sweeteners: -1.20 + -2.00 = -3.20 → capped at **-2.50**
- Oils & Fats: -0.70 + -1.00 = **-1.70** (within cap)
- Subtotal: 5.0 - 4.20 + 0.75 = **1.55**
- Transparency: **x0.95** ("Flavours" is vague)
- **Final: 1.55 × 0.95 = 1.5 (F)**

## Personalized Scoring

The generic score above is the same for everyone. When a request is
**authenticated** (or, for `/similar`, identifies a user via `?user_id=`), the
scoring engine applies that user's saved [dietary preferences](#12-dietary-preferences-api)
as **weight multipliers**, so the same product can score differently for two
users. With no preferences the weights are all-neutral (×1.0) and the score is
identical to the generic one.

### Which endpoints are personalized?
`/product/{barcode}`, `/score/{barcode}`, `/v2/score/{barcode}` (when
authenticated), `/similar/{barcode}` (authenticated **or** `?user_id=`), and the
already user-scoped `/history`, `/favorites`, `/weekly-summary`.

The scoring function itself,
`calculate_health_score_v2(product, version=1, preferences=None, user_id=None)`,
accepts **either** an explicit `preferences` dict **or** a `user_id` (from which
it loads the stored preferences); with neither it returns the generic score.

### How preferences re-weight the score
A preference adjusts the relevant **penalty** or **bonus** (and, for penalties,
the matching category cap is scaled by the same factor so the heavier penalty is
not immediately swallowed):

| Preference | Adjustment |
|-----------|------------|
| `low_sugar` | Sugar nutrient penalty **×1.75**, "Sugars & Sweeteners" ingredient penalty + cap **×1.75** |
| `low_sodium` | Sodium nutrient penalty **×1.75**, "Sodium" ingredient penalty + cap **×1.75** |
| `low_fat` | Saturated-fat penalty **×1.75**, "Oils & Fats" ingredient penalty + cap **×1.75** |
| `high_protein` | Protein nutrient bonus **×2.5** |
| `high_fiber` | Fiber nutrient bonus **×2.5** |
| `vegan` | Dairy-derived "Protein Quality" ingredient bonuses are dropped |

Personalized responses include a `preferences_applied` object (in the `/product`
response and in the score `breakdown`) listing the active flags.

### Worked example — Cadbury Dairy Milk for a `low_sugar` user
Building on the generic example above, `low_sugar` weights the **sugar** terms by
×1.75 (and the "Sugars & Sweeteners" cap by ×1.75 → -4.375):

- Sugars & Sweeteners: (-1.20 + -2.00) × 1.75 = **-5.60** → capped at **-4.375**
- Oils & Fats: **-1.70** (unchanged, within cap)
- Subtotal: 5.0 - 6.075 + 0.75 = **-0.325**
- Transparency: **×0.95**, then clamped to the 1.0 floor
- **Final: 1.0 (F)** — down from the generic 1.5, reflecting the user's stricter
  view of sugar.
